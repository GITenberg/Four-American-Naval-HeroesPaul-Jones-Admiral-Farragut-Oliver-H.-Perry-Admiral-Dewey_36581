<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Four times in the history of our country has the American
navy achieved renown and won the gratitude of the nation.
These four times correspond, of course, to the four great
wars that we have had; and with the
mention of each the name of a famous
hero of the sea is at once brought to
mind. What would the Revolution
have been without its Paul Jones; or
the War of 1812, without its Perry?
How differently might the Civil War
have ended but for its Farragut; and
the Spanish War, but for its Dewey! The story of the
achievements of these four men covers a large part of our
naval history.</p>

<p>Six months after the battle of Lexington the Continental
Congress decided to raise and equip a fleet to help carry on
the war against England. Before the end of the year (1775)
seventeen vessels were ready for service, and it was then
that Paul Jones began his public career. Many other
ships were soon added.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/004ahopkins.png" width="225" height="318" alt="EZEK HOPKINS." title="" />
<span class="caption">EZEK HOPKINS.</span>
</div>

<p>The building and equipping of this first navy was largely
intrusted to Ezek Hopkins, whom Congress had appointed
Commander-in-Chief, but it does not seem that he did all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that was expected of him, for within less than two years
he was dismissed. He was the
only person who ever held
the title of Commander-in-Chief
of the navy. During the war
several other vessels were added
to the fleet, and over 800 prizes
were captured from the British.
But before peace was declared
twenty-four of our ships
had been taken by the enemy,
others had been wrecked in
storms, and nearly all the rest
were disabled. There was no
effort to build other vessels, and so, for many years, our
country had no navy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/004bconstitution.png" width="400" height="283" alt="THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1794, when war
with the Barbary States
was expected, Congress
ordered the building of
six large frigates. One
of these was the famous
<i>Constitution</i>, which is
still in existence and
about which Dr. Holmes
wrote the well-known poem called "Old Ironsides."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Through all the earlier years of our history, John Adams
used his influence to strengthen our power on the sea;
and he was so far successful that he has often been called
"The Father of the American Navy." When the War
of 1812 began the United States owned a great many
gunboats for coast defense, besides seventeen sea-going
vessels. It was during
this war that the navy
especially distinguished
itself, and Oliver Hazard
Perry made his name
famous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/005sloop.png" width="400" height="299" alt="A SLOOP OF WAR." title="" />
<span class="caption">A SLOOP OF WAR.</span>
</div>

<p>The ships of war in
those earlier times were
wooden sailing vessels,
and they were very slow-goers
when compared
with the swift cruisers which sail the ocean now. The
largest of these vessels were called ships of the line, because
they formed the line of battle in any general fight at
sea. They usually had three decks, with guns on every
deck. The upper deck was often covered over, and on the
open deck thus formed above there was a fourth tier of guns.
This open deck was called the forecastle and quarter-deck.
Some of the largest ships of the line carried as many as
120 guns each; the smallest was built to carry 72 guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in size to these ships were the frigates. A frigate
had only one covered deck and the open forecastle and
quarter-deck above it, and therefore had but two tiers of
guns. The largest frigate carried sixty guns, besides a
large pivot gun at the bow. The American frigates were
noted for their speed.</p>

<p>Still smaller than the frigates were the corvettes, or
sloops of war, as they are more commonly called. These
had but one tier of
guns, and that was on
the open deck.
They were rigged like
the larger vessels,
with three masts and
square sails.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/006steamfrigate.png" width="400" height="228" alt="THE STEAM FRIGATE POWHATAN." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE STEAM FRIGATE POWHATAN.</span>
</div>

<p>The fourth class of
vessels included the
brigs of war, which
had but two masts and carried from six to twenty
guns. Equal to them in size were the schooners, which
also had two masts, but were rigged fore-and-aft. The
guns which they carried were commonly much smaller than
those on the sloops and frigates.</p>

<p>After Robert Fulton's invention of the steamboat in 1807
there were many attempts to apply steam on vessels of
war. But it was a long time before these attempts were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
very successful. The earliest war steamships were driven
by paddle-wheels, placed at the sides of the vessels. The
paddles, besides taking up much valuable space, were exposed
to the shots of the enemy, and in any battle were
very easily crippled and made useless. But the speed of
these vessels was much greater than that of any sailing
ship, and this alone made them very desirable. For many
years steam frigates were the most formidable vessels in
the navy. The first successful steamship of war was the
English frigate <i>Penelope</i>, which was built in 1843, and carried
forty-six guns. One of the earliest and most noted
American vessels of the same type was the <i>Powhatan</i>. The
first screw line of battle ship was built by the French in 1849.
It was called the <i>Napoleon</i>, and carried one hundred guns.
It was so successful that steamships soon began to take the
place of sailing vessels in all the navies of the world.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MERRIMAC AND THE MONITOR.</span>
</div>

<p>Up to this time all war vessels were built of wood; but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
there had been many experiments to learn whether they
might not be protected by iron plating. The first iron-clad
ship was built in France in 1858; and not long after that
Great Britain added to her navy an entire fleet of iron-clads.
All these were built after the same pattern as wooden ships,
and were simply covered or protected with iron plates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/008oregon.png" width="225" height="98" alt="THE BATTLESHIP OREGON." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BATTLESHIP OREGON.</span>
</div>

<p>The first iron-clads used in our own navy were built soon
after the beginning of the Civil War (1861), and were designed
for use on the large rivers and along the coast.
They were called "turtle-backs,"
and were
simply large steamboats
covered with thick slabs
of iron and carrying
thirteen guns each. The
iron slabs were joined
closely together and laid in such a manner as to inclose the
decks with sloping sides and roofs. The first great deviation
from old patterns was the <i>Monitor</i>, built by John Ericsson
in 1862. She was the strangest looking craft that had ever
been seen, and has been likened to a big washtub turned
upside down and floating on the water. The <i>Merrimac</i>,
which she defeated in Hampton Roads, was a wooden frigate
which the Confederates had made into an iron-clad
by covering her with railroad rails. They had also, by
giving her an iron prow, converted her into a ram. These <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
two vessels, the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>, were indirectly
the cause of a great revolution in naval warfare; they were
the forerunners of all the modern ships of war now in existence.
The nations of the world saw at once that there
would be no more use for ships of the line and wooden
frigates and sloops of war.</p>

<span class="caption">THE DYNAMITE CRUISER VESUVIUS.</span>
</div>

<p>The ships that have been built since that time are entirely
unlike those with which Paul Jones and Commodore Perry
and Admiral Farragut
won their great victories.
The largest and
most formidable of the
new vessels are known
as battleships, and may
be briefly described as
floating forts, built of
steel and armed with powerful guns. These are named
after the states, as the <i>Oregon</i>, the <i>Texas</i>, and the
<i>Iowa</i>. Next to them in importance are the great monitors,
such as the <i>Monadnock</i> and the <i>Monterey</i>. These are
slow sailers but terrible fighters, and are intended chiefly
for harbor defense. The cruisers, which rank next, are
smaller than battleships and are not so heavily armed;
but they are built for speed, and their swiftness makes up
for their lack of strength. Among the most noted of these
are the <i>Brooklyn</i>, the <i>Columbia</i>, and the <i>Minneapolis</i>. There <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
are also smaller cruisers, such as the <i>Cincinnati</i> and the
<i>Raleigh</i>, that are intended rather for scout duty than for service
in battle. Most of the cruisers are named after cities.
One of the strangest vessels in the navy is the dynamite
cruiser <i>Vesuvius</i>, which is armed with terrible dynamite
guns. Then there is the ram <i>Katahdin</i>. She carries no heavy
guns, and her only weapon of offense is a powerful ram.
Her speed is greater than that of most battleships, and she
is protected by a covering of the heaviest steel armor.
Besides all these there are a number of smaller vessels,
such as torpedo boats and tugs.</p>

<p>A few old-fashioned wooden vessels&mdash;steam frigates and
sailing vessels&mdash;are still to be found in our navy yards, but
these would be of no use in a battle.</p>

<p>In reading of the exploits of our great naval heroes it is
well to keep in mind these wonderful changes that have
taken place in the navy. Think of the slow-going wooden
frigates which sailed the seas in the time of Paul Jones or
Commodore Perry&mdash;how small and insignificant they would
be if placed side by side with the tremendous <i>Oregon</i> or
with the cruisers which Admiral Dewey led to victory in
the Bay of Manila! But if the glory of an achievement is
measured by the difficulties that are encountered and
overcome, to whom shall we award the greater honor&mdash;to
our earlier heroes, or to our later?</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF PAUL JONES.</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Little Scotch Lad.</span></h3>

<p>Many years ago there lived, in the southwestern
part of Scotland, on the beautiful bay called
Solway Firth, a gentleman whose name was Mr.
Craik. In Scotland, a large farm is called an
estate. Mr. Craik named his estate Arbigland.</p>

<p>His large house stood high on the shore overlooking
the sea. The lawn sloped gradually to
the firth.</p>

<p>Mr. Craik's gardener, John Paul, lived in a
cottage on the estate. Mr. Craik was very fond
of John Paul, for he worked well. He made the
grounds like a beautiful park, and planted many
trees, some of which are still standing.</p>

<p>One day John Paul married Jean Macduff.
She was the daughter of a neighboring farmer.
She and John lived very happily in their little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
cottage. They had seven children. The fifth
child was a boy, named for his father, John Paul.
He was born July 6, 1747.</p>

<p>When little John was large enough to run about
he liked to play on the beautiful lawn and to
wander along the shore of the firth. Sometimes
he would sit still for hours watching the waves.</p>

<p>Sometimes he and Mr. Craik's little boy would
play with tiny sailboats and paddle about in the
water. When they grew tired of this, they would
climb among the rocks on the mountains which
were back of the estate.</p>

<p>When there were storms at sea, vessels would
come into Solway Firth for a safe harbor. The
water was very deep near the shore. Because of
this the ships could come so near the lawn of
Arbigland that their masts seemed to touch the
overhanging trees.</p>

<p>Little John Paul and his playmates liked to
watch the sailors, and sometimes could even talk
to them. They heard many wonderful stories of
a land called America, where grew the tobacco
that was packed in some of the ships. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The children would often take their little sailboats
to some inlet, where they would play sailor.
John Paul was always the captain. He had listened
carefully to the commands given by the
captains of the large vessels. These he would
repeat correctly and with great dignity, though he
did not always understand them.</p>

<p>John Paul spent more time in this kind of play
than in going to school. In those days there were
few schools, and book-learning was not thought to
be of much use. At a parish school near by, John
learned to spell and to repeat the rules of grammar.</p>

<p>When he was twelve years old he felt that the
time had come when he could be a real sailor. So
his father allowed him to go across the firth to an
English town called Whitehaven. There he was
apprenticed to Mr. Younger, a merchant, who
owned a ship and traded in goods brought from
foreign lands.</p>

<p>He soon went to sea in Mr. Younger's vessel,
the <i>Friendship</i>. This ship was bound for America
to get tobacco from the Virginia fields. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Young Sailor.</span></h3>

<p>At that time the trip across the Atlantic could
not be made as quickly as now. There were no
steamships, and the sailing vessels had, of course,
to depend upon the wind to carry them to their
destination. It was several months before the
<i>Friendship</i> anchored at the mouth of the Rappahannock
River.</p>

<p>Farther inland, on this river, was the town of
Fredericksburg. John Paul's eldest brother, William,
lived there. He had left his Scottish home
many years before, and had come with his wife to
Virginia. Here he was now living on his own
plantation, where he raised tobacco for the English
market.</p>

<p>While the <i>Friendship</i> was in port being loaded
for its return voyage, John Paul went to Fredericksburg
to stay with his brother. While there
he spent the most of his time in hard study.
Although he was still young, he had found that
he could not succeed as he wished with so little
education.</p>

<p>It was during these months in America that he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
formed the habit of study. All through the
remainder of his life his leisure time was given to
the reading of books.</p>

<p>After he returned to Scotland he spent six years
in the employ of Mr. Younger. During that time
he learned a great deal about good seamanship.</p>

<p>When John Paul was nineteen years of age, the
loss of money compelled Mr. Younger to give up
his business.</p>

<p>John Paul was soon afterward made mate on a
slaver called the <i>Two Friends</i>. This was a vessel
whose sole business was the carrying of slaves
from Africa to America and other countries.</p>

<p>People at that time did not think there was any
wrong in slave-trading. It was a very profitable
business. Even the sailors made more money
than did those on vessels engaged in any other
business.</p>

<p>The <i>Two Friends</i> carried a cargo of slaves to
Jamaica, an English possession in the West Indies.
As soon as port was reached, John Paul left the
vessel. He said that he would never again sail on
a slave-trading voyage. He could not endure to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
see men and women treated so cruelly, and bought
and sold like cattle.</p>

<p>He sailed for home as a passenger on board
a small trading vessel. On the voyage both the
captain and the mate died of fever, and the ship
with all its passengers was in mid-ocean with no
one to command.</p>

<p>John Paul took the captain's place, for no one
else knew so much about seamanship. This was
a daring thing for one so young, as he was not yet
twenty years old.</p>

<p>When he brought the vessel safely into port,
the owners were so grateful to him that they made
him the captain.</p>

<p>Soon afterward he sailed for the West Indies.
The carpenter on board was, one day, very disrespectful
to the young captain. He was punished
by a flogging, and was discharged. Not
long after this he died of a fever.</p>

<p>The enemies of John Paul, who were jealous
of him, thought this was their chance to do him
harm. They said that the flogging had killed
the carpenter.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Many people believed this, and when John
Paul again returned to Scotland, he found that
his friends had lost their faith in him.</p>

<p>During the next two years he made several
voyages, but all the while he remembered the injustice
done to him. He finally succeeded, however,
in proving to his friends that he was worthy
of their confidence.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Beginning of the American Revolution.</span></h3>

<p>When John Paul visited his brother in Virginia,
America was not much like what it is now. Most
of the country was an unexplored wilderness, and
there was no United States as we know it to-day.</p>

<p>Some large settlements, known as colonies, had
been made in that part of the country which lies
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Alleghany
Mountains.</p>

<p>Most of the people who lived in these colonies
were English, and their governors were appointed
by the king of England.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Each governor, with the help of a few men
whom he chose from the people, would make
laws for the colony.</p>

<p>Not all the laws were made in this way. Sometimes
the king, without caring for the wishes of
the colonists, would make laws to suit himself.</p>

<p>Up to this time the people had been obedient
and loyal to their king. But when George the
Third came to the throne of England, he caused
the people a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>He sent orders to the governors that the colonists
should trade with no other country than
his own.</p>

<p>All their goods should be bought in England,
and, to pay for them, they must send to the
same country all the corn, cotton, and tobacco
which they had to sell. The colonists wished to
build factories and weave their own cloth, but the
king would not allow this.</p>

<p>For a long while England had been at war
with France. King George said that the colonists
should help pay the expenses of that war, and
therefore he began to tax them heavily.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>They were obliged to pay a tax on every pound
of tea, and stamped paper must be bought for
every legal document.</p>

<p>The colonists were much aroused on account
of the tea tax and the stamp act, as it was called.</p>

<p>One day startling news came to John Paul in
Virginia. A shipload of tea had anchored in
Boston harbor. The colonists declared that they
would not pay the tax on this tea, and some of
them, dressed as Indians, had gone on board the
vessel and thrown it all into the harbor.</p>

<p>Later on, came the news that the king had sent
his English soldiers to Boston to keep the people
quiet. He had also closed the port of Boston
and said that no more ships should come in or
go out. This aroused the whole country. Everybody
felt that something must be done to preserve
the freedom of the people.</p>

<p>Each colony chose men as delegates to confer
together about what was best to be done. The
delegates met in Philadelphia on the 5th of September,
1774. That meeting has since been
called the First Continental Congress of America.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The delegates of the colonies decided to send a
petition to the king asking that he would remove
the taxes and not make unjust laws.</p>

<p>All winter the people waited for an answer, but
as none came, matters grew worse in the spring.</p>

<p>On the 19th of April, 1775, a battle was fought
with the king's soldiers at Lexington, in Massachusetts.
This was the first battle of the American
Revolution.</p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lieutenant Paul Jones.</span></h3>

<p>In the year 1773, soon after the trouble with
England had begun, John Paul's brother William
died in Virginia. He left some money and his
plantation, but had made no will to say who should
have them. He had no children, and his wife had
been dead for years.</p>

<p>His father had died the year before, and John
was the only one of the family now living who
could manage the estate.</p>

<p>So he left the sea and went to live on the farm
near Fredericksburg, in Virginia. He thought that  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
he would spend the rest of his life in the quiet
country, and never return to the sea.</p>

<p>He soon learned to love America very dearly,
even more than he did his own country. He
wanted to see the colonists win in their struggle for
their rights.</p>

<p>But so good a sailor could not be a good farmer.
In two years the farm was in a bad condition and
all the money left by his brother had been spent.
The agents in Scotland, with whom John Paul
had left money for the care of his mother and sisters,
had proved to be dishonest, and this money
also had been lost.</p>

<p>In the midst of these perplexities, he decided to
serve America in the war which every one saw was
now inevitable.</p>

<p>Another congress of delegates from the colonies
met in 1775, and made preparations for that war.
The colonists were organized into an army, with
George Washington as the commander in chief.</p>

<p>A fleet of English vessels had been sent across
the Atlantic. The swiftest of these sailed up and
down the Atlantic coast, forcing the people in the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
towns to give provisions to the king's sailors and
soldiers. Other vessels were constantly coming
over, loaded with arms and ammunition for the
English soldiers.</p>

<p>George Washington's army was almost without
ammunition. There was
very little gunpowder made
in this country at that
time, and the need of it
was very great.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/028johnadams.png" width="225" height="254" alt="JOHN ADAMS." title="" />
<span class="caption">JOHN ADAMS.</span>
</div>

<p>It was thought that the
best way to supply the
American army with ammunition
was to capture
the English vessels. It was
for this purpose that the first American navy was
organized.</p>

<p>The first navy yard was established at Plymouth.
Here a few schooners and merchant vessels
were equipped with cannon as warships.
These were manned by bold, brave men, who,
since boyhood, had been on the sea in fishing or
trading vessels.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>No member of the Continental Congress did
more to strengthen and enlarge this first navy than
John Adams.</p>

<p>In 1775 John Paul settled up his affairs, left the
Virginia farm, and went to Philadelphia to offer his
services to the naval committee of Congress.</p>

<p>He gave his name as John Paul Jones. Just
why he did this, we do not know. Perhaps he did
not wish his friends in Scotland to know that he
had taken up arms against his native country.</p>

<p>Perhaps he thought that, should he ever be
captured by the English, it would go harder with
him if they should know his English name. We
cannot tell. Hereafter we shall call him Paul
Jones, as this is the name by which he was known
during the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Congress accepted his offer and he was made
first lieutenant on the <i>Alfred</i>, a flag-ship.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Cruise of the Alfred.</span></h3>

<p>The young lieutenant was now twenty-nine
years old. His health was excellent and he could  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
endure great fatigue. His figure was light, graceful,
and active. His face was stern and his manner
was soldierly. He was a fine seaman and
familiar with armed vessels.</p>

<p>He knew that the men placed above him in
the navy had had less experience than he. But
he took the position given him
without complaint.</p>

<p>When the commander of the
<i>Alfred</i> came on board, Paul Jones
hoisted the American flag. This
was the first time a flag of our
own had ever been raised.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/30pineflag.png" width="225" height="237" alt="THE PINE TREE FLAG." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE PINE TREE FLAG.</span>
</div>

<p>We do not know just what this flag was like,
but some of the earliest naval flags bore the
picture of a pine tree; others had a rattlesnake
stretched across the stripes, and the words, "Don't
tread on me." Our present flag was not adopted
until two years later.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, 1776, the first American
squadron sailed for the Bahama Islands.</p>

<p>On the way, two British sloops were captured.
The English sailors told the Americans that on the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
island of New Providence were forts, which contained
a large amount of military supplies. They
said that these forts could easily be taken.</p>

<p>The soldiers on a vessel are called marines.
A plan was made to hide the American marines
in the British sloops. In that way it was thought
they could go safely into the harbor of New
Providence. Then they could land
and take possession of the forts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/031rattleflag.png" width="225" height="212" alt="THE RATTLESNAKE FLAG." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE RATTLESNAKE FLAG.</span>
</div>

<p>This plan would have been
successful, but for one foolish mistake.
The squadron sailed so
close to the harbor during the
night that in the morning all the
ships could be seen from the shore. The war vessels
should have remained out of sight until the
marines had been safely landed from the sloops.
The alarm was spread, and the sloops were not
allowed to cross the bar.</p>

<p>The commander of the squadron then planned
to land on the opposite side of the island and
take the forts from the rear, but Paul Jones
told him he could not do this. There was no  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
place to anchor the squadron, and no road to the
forts.</p>

<p>However, he had learned from the pilots of a
good landing not far from the harbor. When he
told the commander of this, he was only rebuked
for confiding in pilots.</p>

<p>So Paul Jones undertook, alone, to conduct the
<i>Alfred</i> to the landing he had found. He succeeded
in doing this and the whole squadron
afterwards followed.</p>

<p>The English soldiers abandoned the forts, and
the squadron sailed away the same day, carrying
a hundred cannon and other military stores.</p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Captain Paul Jones.</span></h3>

<p>A short time after this, the American squadron
tried to capture a British ship called the <i>Glasgow</i>,
but the attempt was not successful.</p>

<p>Because of this failure, one of the captains was
dismissed from the navy, and the command of his
vessel was given to Lieutenant Jones. This vessel
was named the <i>Providence</i>.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>With it and the <i>Alfred</i>, which he also commanded,
Captain Jones captured sixteen prizes in
six weeks. Among them were cargoes of coal and
dry goods.</p>

<p>Best of all, he captured an English vessel bound
for Canada, full of warm clothing for the British
soldiers. This was a prize that proved of great
value to General Washington's poorly clothed
army.</p>

<p>In those days there were selfish people just as
now. In January, 1777, a jealous commodore
succeeded in depriving Paul Jones of his position
as captain. He was now without ship or rank.
When he appealed to Congress he was put off with
promises from time to time. It was not until May
that his petitions were heard.</p>

<p>There were three new ships being built for the
navy at Boston. Congress gave him permission
to choose one of these and have it fitted out as he
wished.</p>

<p>While waiting in Boston for these ships to be
finished, Paul Jones wrote many wise suggestions
about the management of the navy. Congress at  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
first paid but little attention to these suggestions,
but was afterwards glad to act upon them.</p>

<p>These were some of the things he said:</p>

<p>"1. Every officer should be examined before
he receives his commission.</p>

<p>"2. The ranks in a navy
should correspond to those
in an army.</p>

<p>"3. As England has the
best navy in the world, we
should copy hers."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/034benfranklin.png" width="225" height="309" alt="BENJAMIN FRANKLIN." title="" />
<span class="caption">BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</span>
</div>

<p>Before the ship he had
chosen was completed, he
was ordered to wait no
longer in Boston, but to
take the <i>Ranger</i>, an old
vessel, and sail at once for France. Through the
efforts of Benjamin Franklin, the American Minister
to France, the French king had acknowledged
the independence of the colonies, and was ready
to aid the Americans in the war.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was to carry a letter from Congress
to the American commissioners in Paris.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter told the commissioners to buy a new
fast-sailing frigate for Captain Jones, and to have
it fitted up as he desired. They were then to
advise him as to what he should do with it.</p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Cruise of the Ranger.</span></h3>

<p>When the <i>Ranger</i> sailed out of Boston harbor,
the stars and stripes of the American republic
waved from the mast head.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was the first naval officer to raise
this flag. You remember that two years before,
on the <i>Alfred</i>, he had first hoisted the pine tree
emblem.</p>

<p>When Jones with his ship entered Quiberon Bay,
in France, the French admiral there saluted the
American flag. This was the first time that a foreign
country had recognized America as an independent
nation.</p>

<p>Paul Jones anchored the <i>Ranger</i> at Brest and
went to Paris to deliver his letter, and lay his plans
before the commissioners. He told them two
important things:  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>First, that our navy was too small to win in
open battle with the fleets of the English.</p>

<p>Second, that the way to keep the English vessels
from burning, destroying, and carrying away
property on the American coasts, was to send
vessels to the English coasts to annoy the English
in the same way.</p>

<p>The commissioners thought that these plans
should be carried out at once; and since a new
frigate could not be purchased for some time, they
refitted the <i>Ranger</i> for his use.</p>

<p>On April 10, 1778, Paul Jones set out on what
proved to be a memorable cruise.</p>

<p>You remember that when he first went to sea,
as a boy, he sailed from Whitehaven. This town
is on the English coast, just across the Solway
Firth from John Paul's old home.</p>

<p>He knew there were large shipping yards there,
and he determined to set fire to them. He
planned to reach the harbor in the night, and burn
the ships while the people were asleep.</p>

<p>Because of the wind and tides, it was nearly
midnight when he arrived. He found three  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
hundred vessels of different kinds lying in the
harbor. His men were put into two small boats,
and each boat was ordered to set fire to half the
ships.</p>

<p>It was nearly daylight when they rowed away
from the <i>Ranger</i>. Nothing could be heard but the
splashing of their oars. Their flickering torches
showed to them the old sleeping town, with the
many white ships along the shore.</p>

<p>Leaving orders that the fire be speedily kindled,
Captain Jones took with him a few men, and scaled
the walls of the batteries which protected the
harbor. He locked the sleeping sentinels in the
guardhouse and spiked the cannon.</p>

<p>Then, sending his men back to the harbor, he
went, with one man only, to another fort, which
was a quarter of a mile away. Here he also
spiked the guns.</p>

<p>After all this had been done he returned to his
boats to find that his sailors had done nothing.
Not one ship was on fire!</p>

<p>The lieutenant in charge told Paul Jones that
their torches had gone out. "Anyway," he said,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
"nothing can be gained by burning poor people's
property."</p>

<p>Determined that they should not leave the harbor
until something was destroyed, Paul Jones ran
to a neighboring house and got a light. With this
he set fire to the largest ship.</p>

<p>By this time the people had been aroused, and
hundreds were running to the shore.</p>

<p>There was no time to do more. The sailors
hastened back to the <i>Ranger</i>, taking with them
three prisoners, whom Paul Jones said he would
show as "samples."</p>

<p>The soldiers tried to shoot the sailors from the
forts; but they could do nothing with the spiked
guns. The sailors amused themselves by firing
back pistol shots.</p>

<p>On reaching the ship they found that a man was
missing. Paul Jones was afraid that harm had
befallen him. He need not have been troubled,
however, for the man was a deserter. He spread
the alarm for miles along the shore. The people
afterward called him the "Savior of Whitehaven."</p>

<p>Paul Jones was greatly disappointed by the failure  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of his plans. He knew that if he had reached
the harbor a few hours earlier he could have
burned, not only all the ships, but the entire town.</p>

<p>Although the plan to destroy English property
to aid the American cause, was a wise one, from
a military point of view, yet we cannot understand
why Paul Jones should have selected Whitehaven
for this destruction. There he had received kindness
and employment when a boy. His mother
and sisters lived just across the bay, and had he
succeeded in burning Whitehaven, the people, in
their anger, might have injured the family of the
man who had so cruelly harmed them. We wonder
if he thought of these things.</p>

<p>The Earl of Selkirk lived near Whitehaven, on
St. Mary's Isle. As the <i>Ranger</i> sailed by this
island, Paul Jones thought it would be well to take
the earl prisoner.</p>

<p>There were many Americans held as prisoners,
by the English, and the earl could be exchanged
for some of these.</p>

<p>So, with a few men, Paul Jones rowed to the
shore, where some fishermen told him that the earl  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
was away from home. Paul Jones started to go
back to his vessel. But his sailors were disappointed
and asked his permission to go to the
earl's house and take away the silver.</p>

<p>Paul Jones did not like this plan, but at last consented.
He did not go
with the men, however,
but walked up
and down the shore
until they returned.</p>

<p>The sailors found
Lady Selkirk and her
family at breakfast.
They took all the silver
from the table,
put it into a bag, and
returned to the ship.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">MAP OF THE IRISH SEA, SHOWING THE CRUISE OF THE RANGER.</span>
</div>

<p>Paul Jones was always
troubled about this. He afterwards bought
the silver for a large sum of money, and sent it
back to Lady Selkirk with a letter of apology.</p>

<p>The people in the neighborhood were frightened
when they heard of the earl's silver being taken.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
They ran here and there, hiding their valuables.
Some of them dragged a cannon to the shore,
and spent a night firing at what they supposed
in the darkness to be Paul Jones' vessel. In the
morning they found they had wasted all their
powder on a rock!</p>

<p>The next day the alarm was carried to all the
towns along the shore: "Beware of Paul Jones, the
pirate!"</p>


<h3>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Ranger and the Drake.</span></h3>

<p>An English naval vessel called the <i>Drake</i> was
sent out to capture the <i>Ranger</i>. Every one felt
sure that she would be successful, and five boatloads
of men went out with her to see the fight.</p>

<p>When the <i>Drake</i> came alongside of the <i>Ranger</i>,
she hailed and asked what ship it was. Paul Jones
replied: "The American Continental ship <i>Ranger</i>!
Come on! We are waiting for you!"</p>

<p>After a battle of one hour, the <i>Drake</i> surrendered.
The captain and forty-two men had been
killed, and the vessel was badly injured. Paul  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Jones lost only his lieutenant and one seaman.
Six others were wounded, one of whom died.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/042rangeranddrake.png" width="450" height="353" alt="THE RANGER AND THE DRAKE." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE RANGER AND THE DRAKE.</span>
</div>

<p>This was a great victory for Paul Jones. The
<i>Drake</i> not only mounted two more guns than the
<i>Ranger</i>, but was manned by a crew that was much
better drilled. The vessel belonged to the well-established
English navy, which was accustomed
to victory on the seas.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Towing the <i>Drake</i>, Paul Jones sailed northward
in safety. Then, leaving the Irish Sea, he sailed
around the north coast of Ireland and returned to
the harbor at Brest, with the <i>Drake</i> and two hundred
prisoners. This was just a month from the
day he had set out on his cruise.</p>

<p>The French government had now concluded an
alliance with the American republic. War had
been openly declared between France and England,
and all the French people rejoiced over the
victory of the <i>Ranger</i>.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was not sorry when Congress sent
him an order to bring his vessel to America. It
was needed to protect the coasts of New Jersey
from the war ships of the British.</p>

<p>The French king did not like brave Paul Jones to
return to America. He wished him to remain
where he could be of more direct service to
France. He therefore caused letters to be sent to
him, promising that if he would stay on that side
of the Atlantic he should have command of the new
frigate he had wished for so long.</p>

<p>Pleased with the prospect of this, he gave up  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the command of the <i>Ranger</i>, and it sailed to
America under a new captain.</p>

<p>But promises are often more easily made than
kept. The French navy was well supplied with
ships and officers. These officers were jealous
of the success of Paul Jones, and did all they
could to prevent him from obtaining his commission.</p>

<p>The summer and most of the winter of 1778
passed away, and Paul Jones was still waiting for
his ship. He began to wish he had gone to
America.</p>

<p>Some wealthy men offered him a ship if he
would take charge of a trading expedition for them.
To do this, he must give up his commission in the
American navy, and so Paul Jones said, "As a
servant of the republic of America, I cannot serve
either myself or my best friends, unless the honor
of America is the first object."</p>

<p>During these months of waiting, his only weapon
was his pen. He wrote letters of appeal to all
persons of influence, to Congress, and also to the
king of France.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/045map.png" width="450" height="309" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<h3>IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Bon Homme Richard.</span></h3>

<p>One day, when Paul Jones was reading "Poor
Richard's Almanac," written by Dr. Franklin, he
found a paragraph which set him to thinking. It
was: "<i>If you would have your business done, go;
if not</i>, <span class="smcap">SEND</span>."</p>

<p>He sent no more letters, but went at once to the
French court and pleaded his case there in person.
As a result, he was soon after made commander
of a vessel which he named the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>,
which means <i>Poor Richard</i>. He did this out
of gratitude to Dr. Franklin.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> was an old trading
vessel, poorly fitted out for war. But after his long
months of waiting, Paul Jones was thankful even
for this.</p>

<p>He was also given command of four smaller vessels.
One of these, the <i>Alliance</i>, had, for captain,
a Frenchman named Pierre Landais, who was
afterwards the cause of
much trouble. Paul Jones
was ordered to cruise with
his small squadron along
the west coast of Ireland
and to capture all the English
merchant vessels he
could find.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/046richarddale.png" width="225" height="281" alt="RICHARD DALE." title="" />
<span class="caption">RICHARD DALE.</span>
</div>

<p>The officer next in command
to Paul Jones was
Lieutenant Richard Dale,
who has since been remembered not only for his
bravery during that famous cruise, but for his service
to the country at a later period.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August, 1779, the ships put to
sea. When they reached the southern point of Ireland,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
one of the four small vessels was left behind
and deserted.</p>

<p>Cruising northward, the squadron soon captured
two valuable prizes. Without asking the
permission of Paul Jones, Captain Landais sent
these captured vessels to Norway.</p>

<p>On the way, they were taken by the Danes, who
returned them to England. The value of these
prizes, thus lost through Captain Landais, was
about 40,000, or nearly $200,000.</p>

<p>The squadron sailed round the north of Scotland,
and down the eastern coast until it came to
the Firth of Forth. Here was the town of Leith,
and in its harbor lay some English war vessels.</p>

<p>Paul Jones wished to capture these. The winds
were favorable, and a landing could easily have
been made but for Captain Landais.</p>

<p>Paul Jones spent a whole night persuading
this troublesome captain to help him. It was
only with a promise of money that he at last
succeeded. But in the morning the winds were
contrary.</p>

<p>That day the <i>Richard</i> captured an English  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
merchant ship. The captain promised Paul Jones
that if he would allow his vessel to go free, he
would pilot the squadron into the harbor.</p>

<p>The people, seeing the fleet piloted by the
English vessel, supposed the visit to be a friendly
one. So they sent a boat out to the <i>Richard</i>,
asking for powder and shot to defend the town
from the visit of "Paul Jones the pirate."</p>

<p>Jones sent back a barrel of powder with the message
that he had no suitable shot. It was not until
the vessels were nearing the harbor that the object
of the visit was suspected. The people, in their
fright, ran to the house of the minister. He had
helped them when in trouble at other times, and
could surely do something now.</p>

<p>The good man, with his flock following him, ran
to the beach, where he made a strange prayer.</p>

<p>He told the Lord that the people there were
very poor, and that the wind was bringing to the
shore that "vile pirate," Paul Jones, who would
burn their houses and take away even their clothes.
"I canna think of it! I canna think of it! I
have long been a faithful servant to ye, O Lord.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
But gin ye dinna turn the wind aboot and blaw
the scoundrel out of our gates, I'll nae stir a
foot, but will just sit here till the tide comes in."</p>

<p>Just then a violent gale sprang up, and by the
time it had abated the squadron had been driven
so far out to sea that the plan was given up.</p>

<p>Long afterward, the good minister would often
say, "I prayed, but the Lord sent the wind."</p>


<h3>X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Great Fight with the Serapis.</span></h3>

<p>Paul Jones next cruised up and down the eastern
coast of England, trying to capture some merchant
ships that were bound for London.</p>

<p>About noon, on September 23, 1779, he saw not
far from the shore an English fleet, sailing from
the north. It was convoyed by two new war ships,
the <i>Serapis</i> and the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>.</p>

<p>Paul Jones at once signaled to his ships to form
in line of battle. Captain Landais disobeyed.</p>

<p>The sight of the American squadron seemed to
cause confusion in the English fleet. They let fly  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
their top gallant sails and fired many signals. The
<i>Serapis</i> and the <i>Countess</i> drew up in line of battle
and waited for the enemy, while the merchant ships
ran into port.</p>

<p>It was a clear, calm afternoon. The sea was
like a polished mirror, with scarcely a ripple on its
surface.</p>

<p>The vessels approached each other so slowly
that they scarcely seemed to move. The decks
had all been cleared for action, and the captains
were full of impatience.</p>

<p>Word had gone from town to town along the
shore, that a great battle was soon to be fought.
The people along the shore gathered on the high
cliffs, eagerly hoping to see the dreaded Paul
Jones crushed forever.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down behind the hills before
the ships were within speaking distance of each
other. The harvest moon came up, full and clear,
and shed a soft light over the dreadful battle
that followed.</p>

<p>Captain Landais, when he disobeyed Paul
Jones' order to join in line of battle, spread the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
sails of the <i>Alliance</i>, and went quickly toward
the enemy as though to make an attack. But
when very near to where the <i>Serapis</i> lay, he
changed his course, and sailed away to a place
where the battle could be seen without harm.</p>

<p>About half-past seven in the evening, the
<i>Richard</i> rounded to on the side of the <i>Serapis</i>
within pistol-shot.</p>

<p>Captain Pearson of the <i>Serapis</i> hailed, saying:
"What ship is that?" The answer came: "I
can't hear what you say."</p>

<p>Captain Pearson repeated: "What ship is that?
Answer at once or I shall fire."</p>

<p>Paul Jones' reply was a shot. This was followed
by a broadside from each vessel.</p>

<p>At this first fire, two of the guns in the lower
battery of the <i>Richard</i> burst. The explosion tore
up the decks, and killed many men.</p>

<p>The two vessels now began pouring broadsides
into each other. The <i>Richard</i> was old and rotten,
and these shots caused her to leak badly.
Captain Pearson saw this, and hailed, saying,
"Has your ship struck?"  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The bold reply came: "I have not yet begun to
fight."</p>

<p>Paul Jones saw, that, as the <i>Serapis</i> was so
much the better ship of the two, his only hope lay
in getting the vessels so close together that the
men could board the <i>Serapis</i> from the <i>Richard</i>.</p>

<p>All this time the vessels had been sailing in the
same direction, crossing and re-crossing each
other's course.</p>

<p>Finally Paul Jones ran the <i>Richard</i> across the
bow of the <i>Serapis</i>. The anchor of the <i>Serapis</i>
caught in the stern of the <i>Richard</i> and became
firmly fastened there. As the vessels were swung
around by the tide, the sides came together. The
spars and rigging were entangled and remained
so until the close of the engagement.</p>

<p>With the muzzles of the guns almost touching,
the firing began. The effect was terrible.</p>

<p>Paul Jones, who had only two guns that could
be used on the starboard side, grappled with the
<i>Serapis</i>. With the help of a few men, he brought
over a larboard gun, and these three were all that
he used during the rest of the battle.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the other ships of the American
squadron did strange things. The <i>Pallas</i>, alone,
did her duty. In a half hour she had captured the
<i>Countess of Scarborough</i>. The <i>Vengeance</i> simply
sailed for the nearest harbor.</p>

<p>Worst of all was the conduct of Captain Landais
and his ship <i>Alliance</i>. For a while he looked
quietly on as though he were umpire. At 9:30
o'clock he came along the larboard side of the
<i>Richard</i> so that she was between him and the
enemy. Then he deliberately fired into her,
killing many men.</p>

<p>Many voices cried out that he was firing into the
wrong ship. He seemed not to hear, for, until
the battle was over, his firing continued. The
<i>Poor Richard</i> had an enemy on each side.</p>

<p>Paul Jones sent some men up the masts and
into the rigging to throw hand-grenades, or bombs,
among the enemy. One of these set fire to some
cartridges on the deck of the <i>Serapis</i>. This
caused a terrible explosion, disabling all the men
at the guns in that part of the ship. Twenty of
them were killed outright.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time so much water had leaked into the
<i>Richard</i> that she was settling. A sailor, seeing
this, set up the cry: "Quarter! quarter! Our
ship is sinking!"</p>

<p>Captain Pearson, hearing the cry, sent his men to
board the <i>Richard</i>. Paul Jones, with a pike in his
hand, headed a party of his men similarly armed,
and drove the English back.</p>

<p>Some of the <i>Richard</i>'s men ran below and set
the prisoners free. There were more than a
hundred of them.</p>

<p>One of these prisoners climbed through the port
holes into the <i>Serapis</i>. He told Captain Pearson
that if he would hold out a little longer, the
<i>Richard</i> would either sink or strike.</p>

<p>Poor Paul Jones was now in a hard place. His
ship was sinking. More than a hundred prisoners
were running about the decks, and they, with the
crew, were shouting for quarter. His own ship,
the <i>Alliance</i>, was hurling shots at him from the
other side. Everywhere was confusion.</p>

<p>But he, alone, was undismayed. He shouted
to the prisoners to go below to the pumps or they  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
would be quickly drowned. He ordered the crew
to their places. He himself never left the three
guns that could still be fired.</p>

<p>At half-past ten o'clock, the <i>Serapis</i> surrendered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/055serapisbonhomme.png" width="450" height="300" alt="THE SERAPIS AND THE BON HOMME RICHARD." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE SERAPIS AND THE BON HOMME RICHARD.</span>
</div>

<p>When Captain Pearson gave his sword to Paul
Jones, he said it was very hard to surrender to a
man who had fought "with a halter around his
neck." Paul Jones replied, "Sir! You have
fought like a hero. I hope your king will reward you."</p>

<p>This battle had lasted for three hours and a half.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
It has since been known in history as one of the
greatest victories ever won upon the seas. The
<i>Serapis</i> and the <i>Countess</i> were both new ships,
one of forty guns and the other of twenty. The
crews were well-drilled Englishmen.</p>

<p>Everything was against the <i>Richard</i>, and the
victory was due alone to the great courage and
will of its commander. When the fight was over,
Paul Jones separated the ships and set the sails of
the <i>Richard</i>. All night every sailor was busy
fighting the fire which raged on both ships.</p>

<p>When daylight showed to Captain Pearson the
wreck of the <i>Richard</i>, he was sorry he had surrendered.
Her rudder was gone and her rotten
timbers were split into pieces. Some of the shots
had passed entirely through her.</p>

<p>Paul Jones wished to take her into port to show
how desperately he had fought, but this was out of
the question. By nine o'clock the sailors abandoned
her, and at ten she suddenly went down.</p>

<p>Repairing the <i>Serapis</i> as best he could, Paul
Jones took her and the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>,
with his unfaithful fleet, to Holland.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Honor to the Hero.</span></h3>

<p>After this great victory, Paul Jones was everywhere
received as a hero. The king of France
presented him with a gold sword.</p>

<p>He also sent word, through his minister, that,
with the consent of Congress, he would make Paul
Jones a Knight of the Order of Military Merit. To
avoid delay, the gold cross of the order had been
sent to the French minister in America, who would
present it to Paul Jones when permission to accept
it had been received from Congress.</p>

<p>The hero traveled about in Holland and
France, from city to city, enjoying his great
triumph. Crowds of people were everywhere
eager to see him, and a word with him was
thought to be a great honor.</p>

<p>The most serious fault in the character of Paul
Jones was his vanity. He had always been very
fond of praise and glory, and now his longings
were partly satisfied by all this homage.</p>

<p>Dr. Franklin wrote him a letter, praising him
for his bravery. He thanked him, most of all,
for the prisoners he had captured. There were  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
so many of them that, by exchange, every American,
held by the English, could be set at liberty.</p>

<p>While Paul Jones was enjoying this praise,
Captain Landais was going about also, claiming
for himself the glory for the capture of the <i>Serapis</i>,
and trying to make people believe that he was
the real hero.</p>

<p>When Dr. Franklin heard from the sailors
how he had fired upon the <i>Richard</i>, he ordered
him to Paris to be tried.</p>

<p>During the next year, Paul Jones made a few
short cruises, but accomplished nothing more than
the taking of a few prizes.</p>

<p>At this time the army of George Washington
was sorely in need of clothing and military supplies.
Word was sent to Dr. Franklin to buy
them in France and send them to America by
Paul Jones.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand muskets, with powder, and
one hundred and twenty bales of cloth, were
bought and stored in the <i>Alliance</i> and the <i>Ariel</i>.
Dr. Franklin told Paul Jones to sail with these
goods at once. This was early in the year 1780.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The summer came and passed away, and the
ships were still anchored in the French harbor.
Paul Jones gave excuse after excuse until the
patience of Dr. Franklin was about gone.</p>

<p>Captain Landais had been one cause of the delay.
Instead of going to Paris for trial, as Franklin
had ordered, he had gone back to the <i>Alliance</i>
to stir up mutiny against Paul Jones. He caused
one trouble after another and disobeyed every
order. Finally, by intrigue, he took command
of the <i>Alliance</i> and sailed to America.</p>

<p>But Captain Landais never again troubled Paul
Jones. His reception in America was not what
he had expected. Instead of being regarded as
a hero, he was judged insane, and dismissed from
the navy. A small share of prize money was
afterward paid to him. On this he lived until
eighty-seven years of age, when he died in Brooklyn,
New York.</p>

<p>Another reason Paul Jones gave for his delay
in France was that he wished to get the prize
money due for the capture of the <i>Serapis</i>, and
pay the sailors. This gave him an excuse to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
linger about the courts where he could receive
more of the homage he loved so well.</p>

<p>Then, too, he spent much time in getting letters
and certificates of his bravery from the king
and the ministers. He wished to show these to
Congress when he should arrive in America.</p>

<p>Finally, one day in October, he set sail in the
<i>Ariel</i>. He had not gone far when a furious gale
forced him to return to port for safety.</p>

<p>For three months longer he waited, hoping still
for the prize money that was due. One day he
gave a grand fte on his ship. Flags floated from
every mast. Pink silk curtains hung from awnings
to the decks. These were decorated with
mirrors, pictures, and flowers.</p>

<p>The company invited were men and women of
high rank. When all was ready, Paul Jones sent
his boats ashore to bring them on board.</p>

<p>He, himself, dressed in full uniform, received
them and conducted them to their seats on the
deck. At three o'clock they sat down to an
elaborate dinner which lasted until sunset.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, as the moon rose, a mock  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
battle of the <i>Richard</i> and the <i>Serapis</i> was given.
There was much noise from the firing of guns,
and a great blaze of light from the rockets that
were sent up. The effect was beautiful, but the
din was such that the ladies were frightened. At
the end of an hour this display was ended.</p>

<p>After a dance on the deck, the officers rowed
the company back to the shore.</p>


<h3>XII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Return to America.</span></h3>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1780, nearly a year
after he had received his orders, Jones sailed for
America. He arrived in Philadelphia on February
18th, 1781. When Congress inquired into
the cause of his long delay, he gave explanations
which seemed to be satisfactory. Resolutions of
thanks were passed, and permission given to the
French minister to present the Cross of Military
Merit, which had been sent by the French king.</p>

<p>This cross was presented with great ceremony,
and it was ever after a source of much pride to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Paul Jones. He wore it upon all occasions and
loved to be called Chevalier.</p>

<p>During the following year Paul Jones superintended
the construction of a new war ship, the
<i>America</i>, which was being built by Congress.</p>

<p>This was the largest seventy-four gun ship in
the world, and he was to be her captain.</p>

<p>Once more Paul Jones was disappointed. Before
the <i>America</i> was finished, Congress decided
to give her to France. She was to replace a
French vessel, which had been lost while in the
American service.</p>

<p>Paul Jones was again without a ship. As he
could not bear to be idle, he spent the time until
the close of the war, with a French fleet, cruising
among the West Indies.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard that peace was declared
between England and America, he left the French
fleet and returned to America. He arrived in
Philadelphia in May, 1783.</p>

<p>Now that the war was over, and there was no
more fighting to be done, Paul Jones thought
that the best thing for him to do was to get the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
prize money still due from the French government
for the vessels he had captured.</p>

<p>For this purpose, he soon returned to France.
After many delays the money, amounting to nearly
$30,000, was paid to him. It was to be divided
among the officers and crews of the ships which
he had commanded.</p>

<p>Paul Jones came again to America in 1787 to
attend to the final division of this money.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/063medal.png" width="450" height="226" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>While in this country, Congress ordered a gold
medal to be presented to him for his services during
the war.</p>


<h3>XIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ambitious Hopes.</span></h3>

<p>You remember that, during the war, Captain
Landais had sent two valuable ships to Norway,
and so caused the loss of much prize money.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Denmark had taken these ships, by force, and
given them back to England.</p>

<p>Paul Jones determined to go to Denmark to try
to induce that country to pay for these ships. In
November, 1787, he left America for the last
time.</p>

<p>On the way to Denmark, he stopped in Paris.
Here he heard some news which pleased him very
much.</p>

<p>For some time Russia had been at war with
Turkey, and the Russian navy had lately met
with several disasters on the Black Sea.</p>

<p>The Russian minister in Paris had heard a great
deal about the hero, Paul Jones. So he sent
word to the Empress Catherine, who was then
the ruler of Russia, that if she would give Paul
Jones the command of the Russian fleet, "all
Constantinople would tremble in less than a year."</p>

<p>When Paul Jones heard that this message had
gone to Russia, he was sure that a chance would
come to win still more glory and fame.</p>

<p>He was more anxious than before to go to
Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. He would  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
then be nearer to Russia and could more quickly
answer the summons of the empress.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed in this. He was in
Copenhagen but a few weeks, when he received
the offer of a position in the Russian navy, with
the rank of rear-admiral.</p>

<p>He gave up the hope of the prize money, and
started in April, 1788, for St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The story of his trip to Russia shows what a
fearless man he was. No danger was too great
for him to brave, in order to accomplish any purpose
he had in mind.</p>

<p>In order to reach St. Petersburg with the least
delay, he went to Stockholm, Sweden. Here he
took an open boat and crossed the Baltic Sea,
which was full of floating ice.</p>

<p>He did not let the boatmen know of his intentions
until they were well out at sea. Then,
pistol in hand, he compelled the unwilling men to
steer for the Russian shore.</p>

<p>For four days and nights they were out in the
open boats, carefully steering through the ice, and
many times barely escaping death.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>When, at last, they arrived safely at a Russian
port on the Gulf of Finland, he rewarded the
boatmen and gave them a new boat and provisions
for their return. Scarcely would any one believe
the story, as such a trip had never been made
before, and was thought to be impossible.</p>

<p>He hurried on to St. Petersburg, where he was
warmly welcomed. The story of his trip across
the Baltic, added to other tales of his bravery,
caused the empress to show him many favors.</p>


<h3>XIV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sad Disappointments.</span></h3>

<p>After a few days in St. Petersburg, Paul Jones
hurried on to the Black Sea to take command of
his fleet. But he again met with disappointments.
He was not given the command of the whole fleet,
as he had expected. Instead, he was given only
half, Prince Nassau commanding the remainder.
Both of these men were under a still higher
authority, Prince Potemkin.</p>

<p>Potemkin was as fond of glory as was Paul  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Jones. He and Nassau were both jealous of the
foreigner, and Potemkin finally succeeded in
having Paul Jones recalled to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>He arrived there, full of sorrow, because he had
achieved no fame. More trouble was in store for
him. Some jealous conspirators so blackened
his character that the empress would not allow
him to appear at court.</p>

<p>Even after proving his innocence to the satisfaction
of the empress, he could not regain his
former position.</p>

<p>About this time his health began to fail. Sick,
both in body and mind, he went back to Paris in
1790, having been in Russia about eighteen
months.</p>

<p>It was nearly a year afterward, before he gave
up all hope of regaining a position in the Russian
service. When the empress refused him this, he
quietly waited for death.</p>

<p>This occurred on the 18th of July, 1792, in his
lodgings in Paris. His pride and love of titles had
left him. He told his friends that he wished no
longer to be called Admiral or Chevalier.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>He wished to be simply a "citizen of the
United States."</p>

<p>The National Assembly of France decreed him
a public funeral, and many of the greatest men of
the time followed his body to the tomb. The
place of his burial has been forgotten.</p>

<p>The most enduring monument to his memory is
to be found in the grateful recollections of his
countrymen. The name of Paul Jones, the first
naval hero of America, will not be forgotten so
long as the stars and stripes float over the sea.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STORY OF OLIVER HAZARD PERRY.</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">How the Perry Family Came to Rhode
Island.</span></h3>

<p>A very long time ago, there lived in England a  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
young Quaker whose name was Edmund Perry.</p>

<p>At that time the Quakers were much persecuted.
They were a quiet and peace-loving people, and
would not serve in the army. They had their own
religious meetings, and refused to pay money for
the support of the Church of England. For these
reasons, they were imprisoned, beaten, and driven
from their homes.</p>

<p>Edmund Perry believed that the Quakers were
right, and he could not endure these persecutions.
So, in 1650, he came to America to live.</p>

<p>Thirty years before that time, a company of
Pilgrims had left England because they also
wished to be free to worship God as they chose.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
They had founded a colony at Plymouth, which is
now in the state of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Edmund Perry thought that in this settlement
of Pilgrims he could surely live peaceably in the
enjoyment of his own belief. He did not stay
long in Plymouth, however. His Quaker religion
was hated there, as it had been in England; and
the Pilgrims did not wish to have any one in their
colony who did not agree with them.</p>

<p>Not far from Plymouth was the colony of
Rhode Island, which had been founded by Roger
Williams. Roger Williams declared that a man
is responsible for his opinions only to God and
his own conscience, and that no one has any right
to punish him for his belief.</p>

<p>The people in the Rhode Island colony did not
quarrel with one another about religion, but lived
together in peace.</p>

<p>Edmund Perry thought that this was the place
where he could make a home for himself and his
family. He therefore purchased a large tract of
land on the shores of Narragansett Bay, near what
is now the site of South Kingston.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he lived for the rest of his life, at peace
with all about him, even his Indian neighbors.
His descendants also lived in this neighborhood.
Among them were judges, lawyers, and doctors, as
well as farmers and mechanics; and they were
always highly respected in the colony.</p>

<p>Christopher Raymond Perry, a great-great-grandson
of Edmund Perry, was born in December,
1761.</p>

<p>At that time there were thirteen colonies or
great settlements of English people at different
places along the Atlantic coast of what is now the
United States. But troubles had already begun
to brew between the people of these colonies and
the king of England. These troubles finally led
to the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Christopher Perry, although a mere boy, was
one of the first persons in Rhode Island to offer
himself for this war. He joined a company of volunteers
known as the "Kingston Reds"; but soon
afterwards left the army and entered the navy.
Here he served, having many adventures, until
the close of the war, in 1783.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>He had become very fond of a sailor's life, and
when there was no more use for him in the navy
he obtained a place on a merchant vessel, and
went on a cruise to Ireland.</p>

<p>During the homeward voyage he became acquainted
with one of the passengers, a beautiful
girl of Scotch descent, whose name was Sara
Alexander. Soon after their arrival in America,
their friendship ripened into love, and in 1784
they were married in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Christopher Perry, though but twenty-three
years of age, was then the captain of a vessel.
The young couple went to live with Christopher's
father, on the old Perry estate in South Kingston.</p>

<p>This was then a farm of two hundred acres.
The old homestead stood at the foot of a hill not
far from the Narragansett shore.</p>

<p>Through the trees in a neighboring wood, shone
the white stones which marked the graves of the
Quaker, Edmund Perry, and many of his children
and grandchildren.</p>

<p>The Perry family were glad to welcome Christopher's
young wife into their home. She was as  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
intelligent as she was beautiful; and her sweet
and happy disposition made every one love her.</p>

<p>Christopher Perry gave up his life on the sea for
a time, and many happy months were spent in the
old home.</p>

<p>On the 23d of August, 1785, their first baby
boy was born. He was named for an uncle and
a great-great-grandfather, Oliver Hazard Perry.</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">School Days.</span></h3>

<p>Oliver was a winsome baby and he grew strong
and beautiful very fast. Every one loved him, for
he thought all strangers were friends, and was
never afraid of them.</p>

<p>Indeed he was not afraid of anything, for to
him there was no danger. We shall see that he
kept this same fearlessness all through his life.</p>

<p>When he was three years old, he was playing
one day with an older child, in the road near his
grandfather's house. A man was seen coming
rapidly towards them on horseback. The elder  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
child ran out of the way, calling to Oliver to do the
same.</p>

<p>The little fellow sat quite still, however, until
the horse was nearly upon him. As the horseman
drew rein, Oliver looked up into his face and said,
"Man, you will not ride over me, will you?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/076perryhome.png" width="450" height="328" alt="CHILDHOOD HOME OF OLIVER PERRY." title="" />
<span class="caption">CHILDHOOD HOME OF OLIVER PERRY.</span>
</div>

<p>The gentleman, who was a friend of the family's,
carried him into the house, and told the story.</p>

<p>When scarcely more than a baby, Oliver sat  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
upon his mother's knee, while she taught him
letters and words. It was not long before he could
read quite well. By the time he was five years
old, there were two other babies to keep the
beautiful, loving mother busy. So it was thought
best to send Oliver to school.</p>

<p>Not far from the Perrys', there lived an old
gentleman whom the people loved because of his
goodness of heart. As there was no school near
by, he had often been asked to teach the neighborhood
children.</p>

<p>The good old man was notoriously lazy, and
consented upon one condition&mdash;that he should be
allowed to have a bed in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Teachers were few in those days, and, since
there was no one else, the bed was set up. How
amusing it must have been to see the children
standing about the master's bed and reciting their
lessons!</p>

<p>It was to this strange school that little Oliver
was first sent. Some girl cousins lived on the
adjoining farm. Though they were all older than
he, it was Oliver's duty, each day, to take them to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and from school. No one, not even the other
scholars, thought this at all strange. His dignified
manners always made him seem older than he
really was.</p>

<p>One day his mother told him that he was old
enough to go to school at Tower Hill, a place four
miles away. Boys and girls would now think that
a long way to go to school; but Oliver and his
cousins did not mind the walk through the woods
and over the hills.</p>

<p>The master of this school was so old that he had
once taught Oliver's grandfather. He was not lazy,
however, and was never known to lose his temper.</p>

<p>It was not long until a change was made and
Oliver was taken away from "old master Kelly."</p>

<p>For several years past, Oliver's father had been
again on the sea. He had commanded vessels on
successful voyages to Europe and South America,
and now he had a large income. He was therefore
able to pay for better teaching for Oliver and
the younger children.</p>

<p>So the family moved from South Kingston to
Newport, a larger town, with better schools.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Oliver did not like the change. The
discipline was much more strict than it had been
in the little country schools.</p>

<p>His teacher, Mr. Frazer, had one serious fault.
He had a violent temper which was not always
controlled.</p>

<p>One day he became angry at Oliver and broke a
ruler over his head. Without a word, Oliver took
his hat and went home. He told his mother that
he would never go back.</p>

<p>The wise mother said nothing until the next
morning. Then, giving him a note for Mr.
Frazer, she told him to go to school as usual.
The proud boy's lip quivered and tears were in
his eyes, but he never thought of disobeying his
mother.</p>

<p>The note he carried was a kind one, telling Mr.
Frazer that she intrusted Oliver to his care again
and hoped that she would not have cause to regret
it.</p>

<p>After this Oliver had no better friend than Mr.
Frazer. On holidays they walked together to the
seashore and spent many hours wandering along  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the beach. The schoolmaster took great delight in
teaching Oliver the rules of navigation, and the use
of the instruments necessary for sailing a vessel.</p>

<p>Oliver learned these things so readily that it
was not long until Mr. Frazer said he was the best
navigator in Rhode Island. This, of course, was
not strictly true, but it showed what an apt scholar
the boy was.</p>

<p>Oliver made many friends in Newport. Among
them was the Frenchman, Count Rochambeau.
The father of this man was a great general, and
had once commanded some French troops who
helped the Americans in the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>Count Rochambeau often invited Oliver to dine
with him, and one day he gave him a beautiful
little watch.</p>

<p>When Oliver was twelve years old, his father
gave up his life on the sea. The family then
moved to Westerly, a little village in the southwestern
part of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>For five years Oliver had been a faithful pupil
of Mr. Frazer's, and he was now far advanced
for his years.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Plans for the Future.</span></h3>

<p>About this time some unexpected troubles arose
in our country.</p>

<p>France and England had been at war for years.
The French were anxious that America should
join in the quarrel; and when they could not bring
this about by persuasion, they tried to use force.</p>

<p>French cruisers were sent to the American shores
to capture merchant vessels while on their way to
foreign ports.</p>

<p>You may be sure that this roused the people
from one end of the United States to the other.
Preparations for war with France were begun; and
the first great need was a better navy.</p>

<p>At the close of the Revolutionary War, all work
on government vessels had been stopped. Those
that were unfinished were sold to shipping merchants.
Even the ships of war that had done
such good service, were sold to foreign countries.
In this way, the entire American navy passed out
of existence.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>But now the President, John Adams, went to
work to establish a navy that should give protection
to American commerce.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1798, a naval department was
organized, with Benjamin Stoddert as the first
Secretary of the Navy. The following summer
was busy with active preparations. Six new
frigates were built, and to these were added a
number of other vessels of various kinds.</p>

<p>Captain Christopher Perry was given command
of one of the new frigates that were being built at
Warren, a small town near Bristol, Rhode Island.
This vessel was to be called the <i>General Greene</i>.</p>

<p>In order to superintend the building of this
vessel, Captain Perry, with his wife, left his
quiet home in Westerly, and went to stay in
Warren.</p>

<p>Oliver, then not quite thirteen years old, remained
at home to take charge of the family.</p>

<p>He saw that his sister and brothers went to
school regularly. He bought all the family provisions.
Each day he wrote to his father and
mother, telling them about home affairs. In the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
meantime, he was busily planning what his work
in life should be.</p>

<p>His mother had taught him that a man must be
brave, and always ready to serve his country.
She had told him many stories of battles fought
long ago in her native land across the sea.</p>

<p>Oliver had lived most of his life in sight of the
sea, and had spent many hours with seamen. It is
not strange, therefore, that he should decide,&mdash;"I
wish to be a captain like my father."</p>

<p>He had heard of the troubles with France,
and he longed to help defend his country. And so
at last he wrote to his father, asking permission
to enter the navy. It was a manly letter, telling
all his reasons for his choice.</p>

<p>The consent was readily given, and Oliver soon
afterward received an appointment as midshipman
on his father's vessel, the <i>General Greene</i>.</p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Cruise in the West Indies.</span></h3>

<p>In the meantime, the people grew more eager
for war. An army had been raised to drive back  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the French, should they attempt to invade the
land. George Washington, though nearly sixty-seven
years of age, had been appointed commander
in chief of the American forces.</p>

<p>In February, 1799, one
of the new frigates, the <i>Constellation</i>,
under Captain
Truxton, defeated and captured
a French frigate of
equal size. By spring the
<i>General Greene</i> was completed,
and Captain Perry
was ordered to sail for the
West Indies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/084truxton.png" width="225" height="277" alt="CAPT. THOMAS TRUXTON." title="" />
<span class="caption">CAPT. THOMAS TRUXTON.</span>
</div>

<p>America had large trading
interests with those islands. Many of our
merchant vessels brought from there large cargoes
of fruits, coffee, and spices. The <i>General Greene</i>
was ordered to protect these cargoes from the
French cruisers, and bring them safely into port.</p>

<p>For several months Captain Perry's vessel convoyed
ships between Cuba and the United States.
In July, some of the sailors on board were sick  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
with yellow fever. So Captain Perry brought the
vessel back to Newport.</p>

<p>Oliver went at once to see his mother. The
tall lad in his bright uniform was a hero to all
the children in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>His brothers and sister considered it an honor to
wait upon him. They would go out in the early
morning and pick berries for his breakfast, so that
he might have them with the dew upon them.</p>

<p>While on shipboard he had learned to play a
little on the flute. The children loved to sit about
him, and listen to his music.</p>

<p>By the autumn of 1799, the crew of the <i>General
Greene</i> were well again, and Captain Perry sailed
back to Havana.</p>

<p>It was during the following winter months of
cruising with his father, that Oliver was taught his
lessons of naval honor. He also applied the
lessons in navigation which he had learned from
Mr. Frazer.</p>

<p>He read and studied very carefully, and could
not have had a better teacher than his father.</p>

<p>While the <i>General Greene</i> was cruising among  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the West Indies, Captain Truxton had won
another victory with his <i>Constellation</i>. This time
he captured a French frigate which carried sixteen
guns more than the <i>Constellation</i>.</p>

<p>The French, dismayed at these victories of the
Americans, began to be more civil. They even
seemed anxious for peace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/086constellation.png" width="400" height="279" alt="THE CONSTELLATION." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE CONSTELLATION.</span>
</div>

<p>War had been carried on for about a year,
though it had never been formally declared.</p>

<p>In May, 1800, the <i>General Greene</i> came back to
Newport, and remained in harbor until the terms
of peace were concluded.</p>

<p>The trouble with France being settled, it was  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
decided by the government to dispose of nearly
all the naval vessels. As a result, many of the
captains and midshipmen were dismissed, Captain
Perry being one of the number.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the country, young Oliver was
retained as midshipman.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The War with the Barbary States.</span></h3>

<p>On the northern coast of Africa, bordering on
the Mediterranean Sea, are four countries known
as the Barbary States. These are Tunis, Algiers,
Tripoli, and Morocco.</p>

<p>For more than four hundred years, these countries
had been making a business of sea-robbery.
Their pirate vessels had seized and plundered the
ships of other nations, and the captured officers
and men were sold into slavery.</p>

<p>Instead of resisting these robbers, most of the
nations had found it easier to pay vast sums of
money to the Barbary rulers to obtain protection
for their commerce.</p>

<p>The Americans had begun in this way, and had  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
made presents of money and goods to Algiers and
Tunis.</p>

<p>Then the ruler of Tripoli, called the Bashaw,
informed our government that he would wait six
months for a handsome present from us. If it did
not come then, he would declare
war against the United
States.</p>

</div>

<p>This did not frighten the
Americans at all. Their only
reply was to send a fleet of
four ships to the Mediterranean.
The intention was
to force the Bashaw to make
a treaty which should insure
safety for our ships.</p>

<p>This squadron did not do much but blockade the
ports of Tripoli.</p>

<p>A year later, in 1802, a larger squadron was
fitted out to bring the Bashaw to terms. Commodore
Morris was the commander. On one of
the vessels, the <i>Adams</i>, was Oliver Perry as
midshipman.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of his ship in the
Mediterranean, Oliver celebrated his seventeenth
birthday.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Adams</i> was very fond of
him, and succeeded in having him appointed
lieutenant on that day.</p>

<p>For a year and a half, the squadron of Commodore
Morris cruised about the Mediterranean.
No great battles were fought and no great victories
were won.</p>

<p>The <i>Adams</i> stopped at the coast towns of
Spain, France, and Italy. Through the kindness
of the captain, Oliver was often allowed to go on
shore and visit the places of interest.</p>

<p>Commodore Morris, being recalled to America,
sailed thither in the <i>Adams</i>; and so it happened
that in November, 1803, Oliver Perry arrived again
in America.</p>

<p>His father was then living in Newport, and Oliver
remained at home until July of the next year.</p>

<p>He spent much of his time in studying mathematics
and astronomy. He liked to go out
among the young people, and his pleasing manners  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and good looks made him a general favorite.</p>

<p>He was fond of music and could play the flute
very skillfully. When not studying, he liked most
of all to ride horses, and fence with a sword.</p>

<p>While Lieutenant Perry was spending this time
at home, the war in the Mediterranean was still
being carried on. Commodore Preble, who had
succeeded Commodore Morris, had won many
brilliant victories.</p>

<p>The most daring feat of all this war was accomplished
by Stephen Decatur, a young lieutenant
only twenty-three years old.</p>

<p>One of the largest of the American vessels, the
<i>Philadelphia</i>, had, by accident, been grounded on
a reef. Taking advantage of her helpless condition,
the whole Tripolitan fleet opened fire upon her.</p>

<p>Captain Bainbridge, the commander of the
<i>Philadelphia</i>, was obliged to surrender. The
Tripolitans managed to float the vessel off the
reef, and towed her into the harbor.</p>

<p>Captain Bainbridge, although a prisoner, found
means to send word of his misfortune to Commodore  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Preble, who was then at Malta, and the American
fleet at once sailed for Tripoli.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Captain Bainbridge, the
Americans determined to burn the <i>Philadelphia</i>,
rather than allow the Tripolitans to keep her.</p>

<p>This was a very dangerous undertaking, as the
vessel was anchored in the
midst of the Tripolitan fleet.
It was also within easy range
of the guns of the fort, commanding
the harbor.</p>

<p>The task was given to
Stephen Decatur. In order
to deceive the enemy, he
took a small boat which had
been captured from them a
short time before. Its crew
was made up of volunteers,
for the chances of escape were very few.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/091stephendecatur.png" width="225" height="345" alt="STEPHEN DECATUR." title="" />
<span class="caption">STEPHEN DECATUR.</span>
</div>

<p>Under cover of night, the little vessel sailed
into the harbor, and, as if by accident, ran into
the <i>Philadelphia</i>. Before the Tripolitans realized
what had happened, Decatur and his men were  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
climbing over the sides of the vessel and through
the port holes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/092burningphiladelphia.png" width="450" height="277" alt="BURNING OF THE PHILADELPHIA." title="" />
<span class="caption">BURNING OF THE PHILADELPHIA.</span>
</div>

<p>Decatur had ordered his men to use no firearms.
He did not wish to attract the attention of
the Tripolitans who were in the fort and on the
other vessels in the harbor.</p>

<p>A desperate hand to hand fight ensued. In a
few minutes the Americans were in possession of
the vessel. Some of the Tripolitan crew had
been killed; others had jumped into the sea.</p>

<p>The Americans then set the <i>Philadelphia</i> on  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
fire and jumped into their boat to escape.
Lieutenant Decatur was the last one to leave the
burning ship.</p>

<p>The situation of the little band was now desperate.
The <i>Philadelphia</i> was a mass of flames,
lighting up the harbor for miles around.</p>

<p>Decatur's little boat could be plainly seen, and
all the vessels and forts opened fire on it. But
the Tripolitans were too much excited to do
serious damage.</p>

<p>In a short time the fire reached the magazine of
the <i>Philadelphia</i> and she blew up with a tremendous
crash, leaving the harbor in darkness.
Decatur and his men escaped with but one man
wounded.</p>

<p>This is only one of many deeds of bravery
done in this war, but we can not tell of them in
this story. Lieutenant Perry, in his home in
America, heard of them, and longed to be on the
scene of action.</p>

<p>He was very glad when, in the following
September, he was ordered to return in the
<i>Constellation</i> to the Mediterranean.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The American fleet in the Mediterranean was
by this time so large that the Bashaw was convinced
that the Americans were in earnest.</p>

<p>He was glad to make a treaty of peace and
release the prisoners on payment of a small
ransom.</p>

<p>In October, 1806, Oliver Perry returned to
America. He was greatly disappointed that he
had not been able to take a more active part in
the war.</p>

<p>He spent most of the next two years in Newport,
dividing his time between study and his
many friends.</p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">More Trouble with England.</span></h3>

<p>While America was having these troubles with
the Barbary States, France and England were
still at war. Commerce all over the world was
affected, and in some cases almost destroyed by
this long war.</p>

<p>The French emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, had
forbidden all vessels of other nations to enter  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
British ports. The English, in turn, said that no
vessel should enter a port of France, or of any
country belonging to France.</p>

<p>But the Americans had to endure still further
injuries from the English. British war vessels
claimed the right to stop American ships on the
sea, search them, and carry off American sailors,
claiming them as deserters from the English navy.</p>

<p>The French could not do this; for no American
sailor could be accused of being a runaway
Frenchman.</p>

<p>In 1807, an event took place which nearly led
to war.</p>

<p>The British frigate <i>Leopard</i>, cruising along the
coast, hailed the American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>, and
demanded permission to search the ship.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Chesapeake</i> refused. Without
a word of warning, the <i>Leopard</i> fired into the
<i>Chesapeake</i>, killing and wounding more than
twenty men.</p>

<p>The American captain had not dreamed of such
an outrage. His vessel had just put to sea and
everything was in confusion. He did not even  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
have a gun in condition to return the fire. So he
lowered his flag and surrendered.</p>

<p>The officers of the <i>Leopard</i> then came on board
and carried off four men from the crew.</p>

<p>The United States would have declared war at
once if England had not apologized.</p>

<p>The President, at this time, was Thomas Jefferson.
He was a man of peace. He called a
session of Congress to see if the trouble could not
be settled without war.</p>

<p>As a result of this session, a law was passed
known as the Embargo Act. By this law, no
vessel was allowed to sail from the United States
to any foreign country.</p>

<p>In order to enforce the law, Congress ordered a
number of gunboats to be built. These were to
sail up and down the coast, and prevent any
vessel from entering or leaving the ports.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry was ordered to superintend
the building of a fleet of these gunboats at Newport.
After they were built, he was put in
command of them, and ordered to patrol Long
Island Sound.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time, the government wanted a map of
the harbors in the neighborhood of Newport. On
account of his standing as a seaman, and of his
education, Lieutenant Perry was selected to visit
the harbors and make such a map.</p>

<p>He was given a fast sailing schooner called the
<i>Revenge</i>. While carrying on this work, he was one
day returning from Newport to New London,
when a dense fog came on. The <i>Revenge</i> struck
upon a reef of rocks, and went to pieces.</p>

<p>By great efforts Lieutenant Perry was able to
save, not only all the crew, but the sails, rigging,
and cannon.</p>

<p>He then went to Washington to explain the loss
of the <i>Revenge</i> to the navy department. It was
made clear that it was the fault of the local pilot
who had charge of the vessel at the time.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry was commended for his gallant
conduct in this disaster, and was also granted a
year's leave of absence. He went to Newport, and
on May 5, 1811, he was married to Elizabeth
Champlin Mason.</p>

<p>The young couple took a wedding journey  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
through New England. They spent one day in
Plymouth, Massachusetts. Lieutenant Perry was
much interested in visiting the place where his
Quaker ancestor had lived so many years before.</p>

<p>During this time, the people of the United
States had learned that the Embargo Act was a
very unwise law. The men of Congress had
thought to injure France and England by thus refusing
to trade with them altogether. They soon
discovered, however, that the damage
to American commerce was far
greater.</p>

<p>Trading vessels in the ports were
left standing idle at the wharves,
while the sailors were forced to find
other employment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/098madison.png" width="225" height="268" alt="JAMES MADISON." title="" />
<span class="caption">JAMES MADISON.</span>
</div>

<p>All over the country, there arose a bitter feeling
against this law. In the New England states,
where there were the largest shipping interests,
there was even talk of secession from the Union.</p>

<p>About this time a new President, James Madison,
was elected. Soon afterward the Embargo Act
was repealed, and in its place was passed a law  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which satisfied the people for a time. By this law,
trade was allowed with every country but England
and France.</p>

<p>American vessels now put to sea on voyages to
foreign lands. But their old enemies, the English,
soon began to annoy them
as before.</p>

<p>In May, 1811, the British
sloop <i>Little Belt</i> was hailed
by the American frigate
<i>President</i>, under the command
of Commodore Rodgers.
The reply was a cannon
shot. The <i>President</i>
then poured broadsides into
the <i>Little Belt</i>. After the
English had lost thirty-two men in killed and
wounded, they came to terms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">

<span class="caption">COMMODORE JOHN RODGERS.</span>
</div>

<p>The American people now saw that war could
no longer be avoided. On June 18, 1812, the
formal declaration was made.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">War on the Canadian Border.</span></h3>

<p>Up to this time the English navy had been
called the "Mistress of the Seas." England's vessels
could be numbered by the hundred, and the
crews by the ten thousand.</p>

<p>When this war of 1812 was declared, the entire
United States navy comprised about half a dozen
frigates, and six or eight sloops and brigs. Along
the American coast alone the English had seven
times this number of war vessels.</p>

<p>The first few months of the war were full of
naval surprises. In that brief time the Americans
captured more British ships than the French had
taken in twenty years.</p>

<p>On August 19th, the American frigate <i>Constitution</i>,
commanded by Captain Isaac Hull, in one
half hour captured the English frigate <i>Guerrire</i>.
The English lost one hundred men, and the vessel
was so disabled that she was left to sink. The
Americans lost but fourteen men, and in a few
hours the ship was ready for another battle.</p>

<p>Several other victories followed in quick succession.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
In all this time the Americans did not lose
a ship.</p>

<p>In December, Commodore Bainbridge, the same
officer who had been taken prisoner years before
by the Tripolitans and had afterwards been promoted,
was cruising with the frigate <i>Constitution</i>
off the coast of Brazil. He there encountered and
captured the British frigate <i>Java</i>.</p>

<p>But though so successful on the sea, the Americans
were defeated many times on land.</p>

<p>The possession of the Great Lakes was of the
utmost importance to both the English and the
Americans.</p>

<p>Ever since the Revolution the English had kept
a naval force on these lakes. They had hoped
that some time they might be able to extend the
Canadian territory along the Great Lakes and
down the Mississippi to New Orleans. This would
give them the possession of the great west.</p>

<p>Many prosperous towns and trading posts were
scattered along the Canadian shores. To capture
some of these was the task given to the American
army.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The campaign was opened by General William
Hull. With two thousand men he crossed the
Detroit River, and marched into Canada.</p>

<p>After a few skirmishes with the Indians, he fell
back to the fort at Detroit. Then, without firing
a single gun, he gave up this fort to the English.
This surrender was a great loss to the Americans
for many reasons.</p>

<p>There was, in the west,
a bold Indian warrior
whose name was Tecumseh.
He had a brother
whom the Indians called
the Prophet, because he
was a medicine man and
could do wonderful things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/102tecumseh.png" width="225" height="282" alt="TECUMSEH." title="" />
<span class="caption">TECUMSEH.</span>
</div>

<p>These two Indians wished
to form a union of all the
tribes from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. They
hoped that in this way they might prevent
the white settlers from taking their hunting
grounds.</p>

<p>"The white men are continually driving the red  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
people toward the west; by and by we shall be
driven into the Great Water," they said.</p>

<p>The governor-general of Canada made the
Indians many promises, and tried to incite them
against the United States. In this way he persuaded
many warlike tribes to give aid to the
English. Tecumseh himself crossed into Canada
and joined the British army under General Proctor.</p>

<p>After Hull's surrender of Detroit, the British and
Indians took possession not only of that fort, but
also of Fort Dearborn, where Chicago now stands.
The territory of Michigan was completely in their
hands, and the settlers along the
lakes and all through the northwest
were at the mercy of the
Indians.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/103harrison.png" width="225" height="268" alt="WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON." title="" />
<span class="caption">WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON.</span>
</div>

<p>General William Henry Harrison
tried to regain Detroit. His
advance guard was met and defeated
at the River Raisin, a few
miles south of Detroit. Every American prisoner
was murdered by the Indians; and for years afterward
the River Raisin was a name of horror.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The Americans felt that something desperate
must be done. The first great thing to be gained
was the control of the lakes.</p>

<p>At this time nearly the whole of the western
country was a wilderness. The only way of moving
men and supplies from place to place, was by
the use of boats on the lakes and water courses.</p>

<p>On Lake Ontario a small fleet had been built,
and a skirmish or two had been fought. But the
thing of most importance was the control of Lake
Erie. This would not only give back Detroit to the
Americans, but would also be the means of recovering
the whole of the Michigan territory.</p>

<p>The task of building a fleet and driving the
English from the lakes was given to Lieutenant
Perry.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war he had left his
quiet home in Newport, and had hurried to Washington
to ask for active service.</p>

<p>He was promised the first vacancy, but in the
meantime he was ordered to protect the harbors of
Long Island Sound with a flotilla of gunboats.</p>

<p>During the year 1812 he performed this duty  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
faithfully, all the while drilling his men, in hopes
of being intrusted with a larger responsibility.</p>


<h3>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Oliver Perry Builds a Fleet.</span></h3>

<p>In February, 1813, Lieutenant Perry was ordered
to go to Lake Erie. He was to take with
him, from his gunboats, the men whom he
thought best fitted for the service and report to
Commodore Chauncey, who was in command of the
squadron on Lake Ontario. The American headquarters,
on that lake, were at Sacketts Harbor.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible to reach the place.
From the Hudson River to the shores of Lake
Ontario, was a vast wilderness. No road had
been cut through it; none but Indians could follow
the difficult trails.</p>

<p>The only route known to the white men was
along the Mohawk River to Lake Oneida, then by
the Oswego River to the little village of Oswego on
Lake Ontario. To transport men and arms along
this route was a great task, requiring much time,
skill, and patience.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Oliver Perry was a man of action. On the very
day that he received his orders, he started fifty
men to Lake Ontario, and the next day fifty
more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/106map.png" width="450" height="273" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>On February 22d, in the coldest part of winter,
he left his home and his young wife in Newport,
and with his brother
Alexander, began the
difficult journey towards
the north.</p>

<p>Sometimes they traveled in rude sleighs over the
roughest of roads. Sometimes, when the river
was not too full of ice, they embarked in canoes.
At other times, they could only go on foot through
the thick underbrush. On all sides was a vast  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
wilderness, inhabited only by wild beasts and unfriendly
Indians.</p>

<p>At Oswego, they embarked in boats and followed
the shore of Lake Ontario to Sacketts Harbor.
On one side of them was the dreary inland sea
full of tossing white caps and overhung by the
leaden sky of winter. On the other side lay the
trackless forest.</p>

<p>To relieve their loneliness, they occasionally fired
a musket. The echoes would roll along the shore,
growing fainter and fainter. This only made the
silence which followed seem greater than before.</p>

<p>A cold rain began to fall, and by the time they
reached Sacketts Harbor they were drenched to
the skin.</p>

<p>On March 16th, Lieutenant Perry set out for
Lake Erie. Upon reaching the harbor at Erie he
found that twenty-five ship carpenters had already
begun work on three gunboats and two brigs.
Fifty more carpenters had started four weeks
before from Philadelphia, but had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The task which lay before Oliver Perry seemed
almost an impossible one. Mechanics, seamen,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
guns, sailcloth,&mdash;everything needed for the ships
must be brought hundreds of miles through a wild
and half-settled country.</p>

<p>But by the end of the summer, a fleet, which
seemed to have been built by magic, was ready to
meet the English. Six months before, the timbers
used in building the vessels had been growing trees;
the iron that held these timbers together was either
in the mines or in warehouses or farmers' barns, in
the shape of plowshares, axes, or horseshoes.</p>

<p>The shipbuilders had come through the wilderness
from Philadelphia. The guns, ammunition,
and rigging had been brought in ox-wagons, hundreds
of miles over almost impassable roads.</p>

<p>While Perry was building this
fleet, a sad event had taken place
on the sea. The British frigate
<i>Shannon</i> met and captured the
American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>, June
1, 1813, near Boston harbor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/108lawrence.png" width="225" height="252" alt="CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE." title="" />
<span class="caption">CAPTAIN JAMES LAWRENCE.</span>
</div>

<p>Captain Lawrence of the <i>Chesapeake</i>
fought bravely, but, in the
battle, was mortally wounded. As he was being  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
carried below, his last words were: "Don't give
up the ship!"</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Navy sent word to Lieutenant
Perry to name one of the vessels of his new
fleet the <i>Lawrence</i>, after this gallant captain.
Lieutenant Perry therefore gave this name to his
flagship.</p>

<p>By the 10th of July the fleet was ready for sea,
but there were only officers and men enough to
man one ship. Several of these were ill with fever.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry wrote many letters to General
Harrison, Commodore Chauncey, and the Secretary
of the Navy.</p>

<p>"Give me men, and I will acquire both for you
and for myself honor and glory on this lake, or die
in the attempt," he said.</p>

<p>By the end of July he had over four hundred
men for his nine vessels. But, as he said, they
were a "motley crew" of regular soldiers, negroes,
and raw recruits. During the battle which followed,
over a hundred of these men were too sick
to be of any use.</p>

<p>The English fleet of six vessels was commanded  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
by Captain Barclay. In his crews were over five
hundred men and boys.</p>


<h3>IX.&mdash;"<span class="smcap">We Have Met the Enemy and They are
Ours.</span>"</h3>

<p>Early in August the American squadron left the
harbor of Erie, and sailed to Put-in-Bay, an
island not far from the west end of the lake.</p>

<p>The British squadron was in the harbor of Fort
Malden, nearly opposite on the Canadian shore.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 10, 1813, from
the masthead of the <i>Lawrence</i>, the English fleet
was seen approaching.</p>

<p>As the Americans were sailing out to battle,
Lieutenant Perry gathered his men together and
talked to them about the courage they would need.</p>

<p>He showed them a large blue flag, bearing in
white letters a foot high the words: "Don't give
up the ship!"</p>

<p>"My brave lads," he said, "this flag bears the
last words of Captain Lawrence. Shall I hoist it?"  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>With one voice, the men shouted: "Aye, aye,
sir!"</p>

<p>As the bunting was run up on the <i>Lawrence</i>,
cheer upon cheer came from every vessel of the
American squadron. The men were then sent to
their quarters, and every one quietly waited for
the beginning of battle.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning. The sky was cloudless,
and there was hardly a ripple to disturb the
lake. The English vessels were newly painted, and
gayly adorned with flags. Every sail shone in
dazzling whiteness in the sunlight.</p>

<p>At half-past ten a bugle was heard from the
English flagship, which was followed by cheers
from the other vessels. Across the water the
Americans could hear the strains of the English
national air played by a band.</p>

<p>On the <i>Lawrence</i> all was still. With determined
faces the men stood by the guns.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry knew that a great responsibility
was upon him. He knew that, should he lose
the battle, General Proctor and Tecumseh, with
five thousand soldiers and Indians, were ready to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
cross the lake, and take possession of the southern
shore. All through that part of the country,
anxious men, women, and children were waiting
to flee from their homes, if the dreaded Indians
came upon them.</p>

<p>These things Lieutenant Perry knew. He
passed along the deck, carefully examining every
gun. He had a word of encouragement for each
gun crew.</p>

<p>Seeing some of the men who had fought on the
<i>Constitution</i>, he said, "I need not say anything to
you. You know how to beat those fellows."</p>

<p>As he passed another gun, commanded by a crew
that had served in his gunboat flotilla, he said:
"Here are the Newport boys! They will do their
duty, I warrant."</p>

<p>In this way he filled all his men with a great
earnestness, and a determination to conquer or die.</p>

<p>While the two squadrons were yet a mile apart,
the English sent a cannon ball skimming over the
water. For some time there followed a vigorous
firing from both sides.</p>

<p>As the English guns could carry farther than  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
those of the Americans, Lieutenant Perry brought
his flagship into close quarters. The other American
vessels were some distance behind.</p>

<p>The whole British squadron then opened fire
upon the <i>Lawrence</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour of this unequal battle, the
condition of the <i>Lawrence</i> was pitiable. One by
one the guns had been disabled. Finally only one
on the side toward the enemy could be used. The
rigging was damaged, the spars were shattered,
and the sails were torn into shreds. Eighty-three
men had been killed or wounded.</p>

<p>Two musket balls passed through Lieutenant
Perry's hat, and his clothing was torn by flying
splinters.</p>

<p>One heavy shot crushed into the large china
closet, and smashed every dish with a great clatter.
A dog, that had been locked up there, startled by
the noise, added to the tumult by howling dismally.</p>

<p>Several times the <i>Lawrence</i> barely escaped being
blown up. Two cannon balls passed entirely
through the powder magazine.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the wounded men crawled upon the deck
to lend a feeble hand in firing the guns. It was
Oliver Perry himself, however, that loaded and
fired the last gun of the <i>Lawrence</i>.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry at last determined to change
his flag from the <i>Lawrence</i> to the <i>Niagara</i>. A
breeze had sprung up, which enabled this vessel to
come near to the helpless <i>Lawrence</i>.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant was left in command of the
<i>Lawrence</i>, with orders to hold out to the last.
Then with his brother Alexander and four seamen,
Lieutenant Perry got into a rowboat. Just as
they were shoving off, a seaman on the <i>Lawrence</i>
hauled down the blue flag, bearing the motto,
"Don't give up the ship!" He rolled it up and
tossed it to Perry.</p>

<p>The smoke of the battle was so dense that the
rowboat had nearly reached the <i>Niagara</i> before it
was seen by the English. Then a shot was sent
which went straight through the boat's side.</p>

<p>Taking off his coat and rolling it up, Perry
quickly thrust it into the hole which the ball had
made. This kept the boat from sinking.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>As he stepped upon the deck of the <i>Niagara</i>,
Perry ordered the blue flag to be hoisted. Just at
this moment the <i>Lawrence</i> surrendered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/115lakeerie.png" width="450" height="217" alt="THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE.</span>
</div>

<p>The English gave a cheer, thinking they had
won the battle. They were not able, however, to
board and take the <i>Lawrence</i> at once, and so she
drifted away. When safely out of range her
colors were rehoisted.</p>

<p>Bringing the <i>Niagara</i> into position, Lieutenant
Perry fired a terrific broadside into one of the English
vessels. Then he sailed quickly to another
and did the same thing.</p>

<p>The other American vessels followed this example,
and a terrific battle followed.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>In just fifteen minutes the English surrendered.
Two vessels of their squadron attempted to escape,
but were soon overtaken and captured.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Perry was determined that the
formal surrender should take place on the <i>Lawrence</i>.
So once more he lowered his flag, and
jumping into a boat, made for his first flagship.</p>

<p>When he stepped on board the <i>Lawrence</i> not a
cheer was heard. The handful of men that were
left silently greeted their commander.</p>

<p>Few of them were uninjured. Some had splintered
arms and legs. Others had bandages about
their heads. Their faces were black with powder.</p>

<p>The English officers came on board to present
their swords to Perry. With quiet dignity he
returned each one.</p>

<p>He then took from his pocket an old letter.
Using his cap for a desk, he wrote with a pencil
his famous dispatch to General Harrison:</p>

<p>"We have met the enemy and they are ours.
Two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and one sloop.
Yours, with very great respect and esteem,</p>

<p class="sig">
"O.H. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>."<br />
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>


<h3>X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">What Perry's Victory Accomplished.</span></h3>

<p>The battle on Lake Erie was the beginning of
the end of the war. The news of the victory
caused great rejoicings all over the country. In
all the principal towns there were meetings, bonfires,
and torchlight processions.</p>

<p>General Harrison could now take his army into
Canada. No time was lost. He hurried over four
thousand men to the lake, where Perry's fleet
waited to take them across.</p>

<p>The main body of the British army, under
General Proctor and Tecumseh, was at Fort Malden.
Upon landing there the Americans found
that the enemy had fled, having burned the forts,
barracks, and stores.</p>

<p>General Harrison followed the English up the
left bank of the Detroit River. The fort at Detroit
was surrendered without any resistance, and
the English retreated along the St. Clair Lake
and up the Thames River.</p>

<p>The Americans steadily pursued them. Perry,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
with his fleet, followed the army, carrying the
baggage and provisions.</p>

<p>He became so excited over the chase that he
could not remain quietly on his ships. So, leaving
them in charge of one of his officers, he went
ashore and offered his services to General Harrison
as aid-de-camp.</p>

<p>As he joined the army he was met with cheers
of welcome from the soldiers. General Harrison
afterward said: "The appearance of the gallant
Perry cheered and animated every soldier."</p>

<p>Following the English some distance up the
Thames, the Americans finally overtook them.
They were drawn up in line of battle on a narrow
strip of land which lay between the river and a
large swamp.</p>

<p>The American cavalry made a bold dash
through these lines, and the enemy was soon
routed. Over sixty British and Indians were
killed, and six hundred troops were made prisoners.
General Proctor made his escape, but Tecumseh
was killed.</p>

<p>The death of this great chief severed forever the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
tie which bound the Indians to the English. Soon
afterwards all the tribes of the northwest declared
submission to the United States. The white settlers
in the region about the Great Lakes were
thus freed from their fear of the savages.</p>

<p>During the battle of the Thames, the soldiers
greatly admired the fine horsemanship of Oliver
Perry. He rode a powerful black horse, with a
white face, that could be seen from all parts of the
field.</p>

<p>Once, when riding swiftly to carry out some orders
of the general's, the horse plunged into the deep
mire to his breast. Perry pressed his hands on
the pommel of the saddle, and sprang over the
horse's head to dry ground.</p>

<p>Relieved from the weight of his rider, the
horse freed himself and bounded forward. Perry
clutched the mane as he passed and vaulted into
the saddle, without stopping the animal's speed for
a moment. As he passed the soldiers, many
cheers arose.</p>

<p>On October 7, 1813, Perry returned to Detroit,
and from there started back to his home in Newport.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
The people hailed him with joy, and enough
could not be said in his praises. Even Captain
Barclay of the English fleet called him "The gallant
and generous enemy."</p>

<p>His journey to Newport was indeed a triumphal
one. In every town that he passed through, business
was stopped and the schools were closed so
that all could have a glimpse of the hero of Lake
Erie. Processions accompanied him from town to
town.</p>

<p>On November 18th, he reached his home in
Newport. Bells were rung, all the ships were
adorned with
flags, and salutes
were fired in his
honor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/120congressionalmedal.png" width="400" height="206" alt="GOLD MEDAL AWARDED BY CONGRESS." title="" />
<span class="caption">GOLD MEDAL AWARDED BY CONGRESS.</span>
</div>

<p>On November
29th, he received
his promotion to
the rank of captain.
At that time this was the highest rank in
the American navy. A gold medal was also given
to him by Congress.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following January he made a visit to
Washington, where he was publicly entertained by
the President and citizens.</p>

<p>In August, 1814, he was ordered to command a
new frigate named the <i>Java</i>. He hastened to
Baltimore, where this vessel was to be launched.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September, Lieutenant Macdonough,
who was in command of the American
squadron on Lake Champlain, gained a decisive
victory over the British near Plattsburg. Everything
at the North seemed now to be favorable
to the Americans; but it was not so at the
South.</p>

<p>While Captain Perry was waiting at Baltimore,
the British had sailed up the Potomac with an
army and a fleet. They captured Washington,
and burned the capitol, the White House, and
some of the other public buildings.</p>

<p>Being so successful in this, they made a like
attempt upon Baltimore, but were driven back.
They then blockaded Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>Just at this time, Congress passed a bill to fit
out two squadrons of fast-sailing vessels. These  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
were to cruise near the English coasts and destroy
the commerce between the different ports.</p>

<p>Captain Perry was ordered to leave the <i>Java</i>
and command one of these squadrons. But before
he could sail for England, peace was declared. A
treaty with that country was signed December
24, 1814.</p>


<h3>XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">On the Mediterranean Again.</span></h3>

<p>While the United States had been at war with
England, trouble had again arisen with the Barbary
States. None of these countries had been so
annoying as Algiers. The ruler, or Dey, of Algiers
knew that every American naval vessel was busy
fighting the English. He therefore thought this a
good time to burn and plunder the merchant ships.
He also demanded large sums of money in return
for his captured prizes and prisoners.</p>

<p>But no sooner was peace concluded with England,
than Congress declared war with Algiers. A
squadron was sent to the Mediterranean, commanded
by the brave Stephen Decatur, and he  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
soon compelled the Dey to sign a treaty with the
United States.</p>

<p>In this treaty the Dey promised to give back all
the American property he had captured. If there
was anything that he could not return, he was to
pay for it at its full value. He was also to release all
the Americans he held as prisoners, and give up,
forever, all claim to tribute money from the United
States.</p>

<p>When the consuls of other countries heard of
what Decatur had accomplished, they tried to persuade
the Algerine ruler to make the same terms
with them. Then the Dey was sorry that he had
"humbled himself" before the young republic, and
he declared that he did not consider the treaty
binding.</p>

<p>Congress therefore thought it wise to strengthen
the American squadron in the Mediterranean, in
order that this trouble should be settled.</p>

<p>Captain Perry was ordered to take the <i>Java</i> and
sail at once for Algiers. On January 22, 1816, he
set sail, and in March he joined the American
vessels off the eastern coast of Spain.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon arriving at Algiers, they found that the
Dey had just received a large amount of tribute
money from an English fleet. This made him
very unwilling to talk about treaties.</p>

<p>The English fleet had not only brought money
to pay for the release of English prisoners, but
also had brought vast sums from the governments
of Naples and Sardinia to buy the freedom of their
enslaved countrymen.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred captives were freed in this
way, and put aboard the English vessels. There
were people of all ages, clothed in rags. Some
had been taken while young and now were old men,
with gray hair and beards.</p>

<p>The Dey refused to treat with the American
commander, and the Americans would have destroyed
the Algerian fleet and bombarded the town
at once, but for an article in the treaty which
Decatur had made. This article stated that when
either side should become dissatisfied with the
treaty, three months' notice should be given before
actual fighting began.</p>

<p>While waiting for these three months to pass,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the American squadron cruised about the Mediterranean
and visited the other Barbary States. The
commander wished to show the rulers of these
states that our country had a navy which could
protect our commerce.</p>

<p>After this the fleet sailed along the southern
coast of Europe. There was no vessel
which attracted more admiration than Captain
Perry's <i>Java</i>. To visit this ship was, indeed, a
pleasure.</p>

<p>The captain was a courteous host, and always
made his guests welcome. Everything on the ship
was in order, and ready for instant use. The discipline
of the crew was perfect.</p>

<p>Being a good musician himself, Captain Perry
had the finest band in all the fleet. He took a
personal interest in each one of his men, and was
always ready with a word of praise when he saw it
was deserved. He gave the midshipmen lessons
in navigation, and saw that they had lessons in
Spanish and French and in the use of the sword.
They were even taught to dance.</p>

<p>Whenever it was possible the men were allowed  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
to go on shore, in order that they might visit the
places of interest.</p>

<p>By January, 1817, the Dey of Algiers finally
came to terms and signed a new treaty, agreeing
to the conditions required by the United States.
Captain Perry was soon afterwards ordered to
sail for America, carrying this new treaty with
him. In March he arrived at Newport.</p>


<h3>XII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Captain Perry's Last Cruise.</span></h3>

<p>After so many months of cruising, Captain Perry
was very glad to be again in his own country.</p>

<p>He spent the next two years quietly at home
with his family. He built a snug little cottage in
Narragansett, on the old Perry estate. This was
the same farm that had been purchased by the
young Quaker, Edmund Perry, so many years
before. Here the family spent the summers.</p>

<p>Captain Perry was always fond of life in the
country. He took many long rides on horseback.
Besides his horses, he had many other pets on the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
farm. He and his three little sons spent a great
deal of time taking care of them.</p>

<p>The winters were passed in the house at
Newport.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/127perrysresidence.png" width="400" height="265" alt="CAPTAIN PERRY&#39;S RESIDENCE AT NEWPORT." title="" />
<span class="caption">CAPTAIN PERRY&#39;S RESIDENCE AT NEWPORT.</span>
</div>

<p>These were the happiest years of Oliver Perry's
life, and he could not help but be sorry, when, on
March 31, 1819, he received a summons to go to
Washington.</p>

<p>Upon arriving there, the Secretary of the Navy
told him of an expedition that the government
wished him to undertake.</p>

<p>He was to go to Venezuela, on the northern
coast of South America. This was a new republic  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which had formerly been a colony of Spain. Its
people were still fighting for their independence,
just as the people of the United States had fought
against the king of England.</p>

<p>Small, fast-sailing war vessels, called privateers,
had been fitted out by this republic. These vessels
were designed to capture Spanish merchant
ships, and were allowed to keep all the money that
was obtained from the prizes.</p>

<p>But it was not the Spanish ships alone which
suffered from these privateers. The desire for
prize money led them to attack ships of other
nations. The American merchants had met with
many losses in this way.</p>

<p>Captain Perry was to present claims for these
losses, and also to persuade the president of
Venezuela to keep his privateers from preying on
American commerce. For this expedition, Perry
was to have two vessels, the sloop <i>John Adams</i>
and the schooner <i>Nonsuch</i>.</p>

<p>On July 15, 1819, he arrived at the mouth of
the Orinoco River. Here he was obliged to take
the small schooner in order to go up the river and  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
reach the town of Angostura, which was then the
Venezuelan capital. He sent the <i>John Adams</i> to
Port Spain, on the island of Trinidad, one hundred
and fifty miles away. This vessel was ordered
to wait there for his return.</p>

<p>The voyage up the Orinoco was an interesting
one. All along the shores were vast tropical forests
with overhanging trees full of birds of brilliant
colors. Luxuriant vines were festooned from limb
to limb. Flowers of all colors grew everywhere.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the trip was full of hardships.
The heat was fearful and the sand-flies, gnats,
and mosquitoes were almost unbearable.</p>

<p>Soon after reaching Angostura many of the
crew were taken ill with yellow fever, but Perry
would not leave until his mission was accomplished.
After three weeks of delay, he succeeded
in getting the promises for which he had come.</p>

<p>The schooner then sailed down the river, reaching
the mouth on August 15th. On account of a
high sea, to cross the bar that night would be a
dangerous undertaking, and the vessel was therefore
anchored until morning.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night, the wind freshened so much
that the spray dashed into the cabin where Captain
Perry was sleeping. In the morning he awoke with
a cold chill and symptoms of yellow fever.</p>

<p>Every effort was made to reach the <i>John Adams</i>
as soon as possible. Captain Perry grew rapidly
worse. In the intense heat, his little schooner
cabin was most uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The winds were unfavorable and the progress of
the little vessel was slow. When within a mile of
the <i>John Adams</i>, Captain Perry died. This was
on his thirty-fourth birthday, August 23, 1819.</p>

<p>He was buried on the island of Trinidad with
military honors, and the <i>John Adams</i> brought back
the sad news to the United States.</p>

<p>His death was regarded as a national calamity.
The government sent a war vessel to bring his body
home. He was finally laid to rest at Newport,
where a granite monument marks his grave.</p>

<p>The feelings of his fellow officers were well
expressed by Stephen Decatur. Upon hearing of
Perry's death, he said: "Sir! The American navy
has lost its brightest ornament!"  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STORY OF ADMIRAL FARRAGUT.</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Childhood.</span></h3>

<p>On July 5, 1801, in a rude cabin in Eastern  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Tennessee, David Glasgow Farragut was born.</p>

<p>It was a wild and lonely place. For miles
around the little farm, nothing could be seen but
woods. Few sounds could be heard save the singing
of birds and sometimes the cries of wild
beasts.</p>

<p>There was already one child in the family, a
boy, whose name was William.</p>

<p>George Farragut, the father, was a brave man.
He was a Spaniard, and had come to America
during the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>He was a lover of liberty, and for that reason he
had taken up arms with the colonists to help them
win their independence from England.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>After the close of the war, he had married a
hardy frontier girl, and had come to this wild place
to make his home.</p>

<p>His life on the little clearing in the backwoods
was one of toil and frequent hardships. Every day
he was busy chopping down trees, planting crops, or
hunting in the great forest.</p>

<p>The young wife, Elizabeth, was also busy, keeping
her house and spinning and making the clothes
for herself, her husband, and her children.</p>

<p>Little David Farragut grew strong very fast.</p>

<p>He and William had no playmates, but they
liked to run about under the trees. They could
not go far from the cabin, however, as there were
both wild beasts and Indians in the woods.</p>

<p>Sometimes the father would be away for several
days, hunting wild game for the family to eat. At
such times, the mother and children would be left
alone.</p>

<p>One day a band of Indians came and tried to
enter the cabin. The mother sent the boys into
the loft, where they crouched down close to the
roof and kept very still. Then, for hours, she  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
guarded the door with an axe, until, at last,
something frightened the Indians and they went
away.</p>

<p>When little David was about seven years old,
his father was appointed by the government to
command a gunboat on the Mississippi. As his
headquarters were to be at New Orleans, the
family moved to a plantation on the banks of Lake
Pontchartrain. This lake is near the city.</p>

<p>When not on duty on the gunboat, George Farragut
was very fond of sailing on the lake. He
had a little sailboat in which he would take the
children, even in severe storms.</p>

<p>Sometimes the weather would be so bad that they
couldn't come home; and then they would sleep all
night on the shore of some island. The father
would wrap the children in a sail, or cover them
with dry sand to keep them warm.</p>

<p>One day a neighbor told him that it was dangerous
to take the children on such trips. George Farragut
replied, "Now is the time to conquer their
fears."</p>

<p>When fishing in the lake one morning, George  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Farragut saw a boat in which there was an old man
all alone. Pulling alongside, he found that the
stranger had become unconscious from the heat of
the sun.</p>

<p>He was taken to the Farragut home, and, although
he was nursed for some time with the greatest
of care and everything was done for him that
could be done, yet he grew no better.</p>

<p>Finally Mrs. Farragut also was taken very ill,
and in a few days both she and the stranger she
had nursed so tenderly, died. This was a sad day
for the family of George Farragut.</p>

<p>Not long after the funeral, a stranger called
at the Farragut house. He said that his name
was David Porter and that he was the son of the
old gentleman who had died there. He thanked
George Farragut for his kindness to his father, and
offered to adopt one of the Farragut boys.</p>

<p>There were now five children in the family, and
David's father was very glad to accept this offer.
The oldest son, William, already had a commission
as midshipman in the navy, and so it was
decided that David should be the one to go.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Porter was at that time the commander
of the naval station at New Orleans. His handsome
uniform, with its belt and shining buttons,
seemed very attractive to little David, and he was
eager to go with his new guardian.</p>

<p>David spent a few months with the Porter family
in New Orleans. Then Captain Porter took him
to Washington and placed him in school there.</p>

<p>One day David was introduced to a great man,
the Secretary of the Navy. He asked the boy
many questions, and was so pleased with his intelligent
answers that he said to him, "My boy, when
you are ten years old I shall make you a midshipman
in the navy."</p>

<p>This was a proud moment for little David Farragut.
The great man did not forget his promise.
The appointment came six months before the time
that was named. It was arranged that the lad
should go with Captain Porter in the frigate
<i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>It was several months, however, before the vessel
was ready to sail. In the meantime, David attended
a school in Chester, Pennsylvania.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Little Midshipman.</span></h3>

<p>For a long time England had been at war with
France. British men-of-war and privateers were
in the habit of attacking any vessel going to or
from the ports of France. More than this, the
British government claimed the right to search
American vessels to see whether any English
sailors were on board.</p>

<p>Nor was this the worst. Numbers of American
seamen were falsely accused of being English
deserters, and every year many were taken from
their own vessels and forced to serve on British
ships.</p>

<p>The Americans tried to induce the British government
to cease this unjust treatment. They
tried to settle the matter peaceably, but the British
were haughty and overbearing and would not agree
to give up any of their claims.</p>

<p>On June 18, 1812, things had gone so far that our
country was obliged to declare war against Great
Britain. A squadron was fitted out and ordered
to cruise along the Atlantic coast, in order to protect
American vessels from the British.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Porter's vessel, the <i>Essex</i>, was to be one
of this fleet. It was not ready, however, to sail
with the others; but orders were given that it
should follow as soon as possible and join the
squadron in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>If Captain Porter could
not find the squadron, he
was to do whatever he
thought best.</p>

<p>On October 28, 1812, the
<i>Essex</i> sailed down the Delaware
River, and through
the bay into the ocean.
There was a pennant flying
from the mast-head on
which were the words, "Free Trade and Sailors'
Rights." It was for these things that Captain
Porter was ready to fight. By his side stood
the little midshipman, David Farragut, in his
shining uniform. There was no prouder boy in all
America than he was on that day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">

<span class="caption">CAPTAIN DAVID PORTER.</span>
</div>

<p>For several months, Captain Porter cruised
about the Atlantic. He captured several English  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
vessels, and then, as he could not find the American
squadron, he decided to make a trip around
Cape Horn, and cruise in the Pacific.</p>

<p>The passage around Cape Horn is one of the
most dangerous in the world, but Captain Porter
was not afraid. The <i>Essex</i> was one of the best
ships in the navy, and the crew had been drilled
very thoroughly.</p>

<p>Sometimes Captain Porter sounded a false alarm
of fire on shipboard. This was to test the courage
of the men and prepare them for accidents. Sometimes
he even caused a smoke to be made. The
sailors soon became so accustomed to a cry of
"Fire" that it caused no confusion.</p>

<p>The courage of the crew was severely tried in
going around Cape Horn. The weather was bitterly
cold, and for twenty-one days the ship was
buffeted by furious storms.</p>

<p>By this time the provisions were almost gone.
Each man had but a small daily allowance of
bread and water. Little David Farragut was
having his first real experience as a sailor.</p>

<p>From Cape Horn, Captain Porter sailed north  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
along the west coast of South America, and
stopped at an island near the coast of Chili. The
sailors went on shore with their guns and killed
some wild hogs and horses. They were in such
need of fresh meat that they ate even the flesh of
the horses with great relish.</p>

<p>For months the <i>Essex</i> cruised about in the
beautiful Pacific. Captain Porter captured several
English vessels, and warned American whaling-ships
of danger. Some of these had been at sea
for many months and had not heard of the
war.</p>

<p>Sometimes the <i>Essex</i> would stop at an island,
and the crew would go on shore to kill seals;
sometimes they would anchor in shallow bays and
fish for cod.</p>

<p>On one solitary island there was a strange postoffice,
a box nailed to a tree. Here passing vessels
would leave messages and letters, to be taken
up by other vessels that chanced to be going in
the right direction.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> stopped at this island for some time.
The crew found prickly pears to eat. They killed  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
pigeons, which the cook made into pies, and they
made soup of the turtles they caught. Those
were great days for David Farragut.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> finally left this island in May, 1813.
Soon more English vessels were sighted and
captured. One of these was to be taken to Valparaiso,
and Captain Porter put David Farragut
in charge of it. The young commander was then
but twelve years of age.</p>

<p>The gray-haired English captain was very angry
at having to take orders from a boy. He tried
to ignore David, and when he failed in this,
attempted to frighten him. He threatened to
shoot any man who obeyed David's orders, and
went below for his pistols.</p>

<p>David knew that the American sailors were loyal
to him. So he sent word to the captain that if he
did not obey, he would have him thrown overboard.</p>

<p>After this there was no more trouble. David
brought the vessel into the port of Valparaiso in
safety. He soon afterward rejoined the <i>Essex</i>.</p>

<p>Captain Porter now decided to go to some  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
islands far out in the Pacific, where he could refit
the ship.</p>

<p>As the <i>Essex</i> approached one of these islands,
she was met by a canoe filled with natives. The
bodies of these people were tattooed, and they were
gayly ornamented with feathers. They invited
the sailors on shore, and promised to give them
fruit and provisions.</p>

<p>During the six weeks that were occupied in refitting
the ship, the sailors rested on the island.
David and the other boys of the crew were given
lessons by the ship's chaplain each day, and when
school hours were over, they were allowed to visit
the islanders.</p>

<p>The young natives taught the American boys
many things. They showed them how to walk
on stilts, and how to use a spear skillfully and with
ease. Best of all, they taught them how to swim.
The people of this island could swim as easily as
they could walk. Even the babies could float in the
water like ducks.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> left this island in December, 1813,
and sailed for Valparaiso.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Loss of the Essex.</span></h3>

<p>One day in the following February, two English
war vessels appeared in the harbor of Valparaiso.
The <i>Essex</i> was lying quietly at anchor, and many
of her crew were on shore.</p>

<p>The British vessels bore down upon the <i>Essex</i>
in a very hostile manner. Captain Porter was
afraid they would attack him. They had no right
to do this, for Chili was not at war with either
England or America.</p>

<p>One of these British vessels was a frigate called
the <i>Phoebe</i>. The other was a sloop named the
<i>Cherub</i>. The <i>Phoebe</i> approached the <i>Essex</i> until
she was within fifteen feet of her side.</p>

<p>Captain Porter, standing on the deck, hailed,
saying: "If you touch a single yardarm, I shall
board you instantly!" The <i>Phoebe</i> passed by with
no reply.</p>

<p>After this, the British vessels anchored at the
entrance of the harbor. They could thus keep the
<i>Essex</i> a prisoner.</p>

<p>The vessels remained in this position for several
weeks. On the 28th of March, a furious gale  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
sprang up. The cables of the <i>Essex</i> gave way,
and she began to drift out toward the English
vessels. Captain Porter now made a desperate
effort to escape. He set all sails and made for
the open sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly something snapped. The main top-mast
came crashing down, carrying sails, rigging,
and some of the crew into the water. In this disabled
condition escape was impossible. The <i>Essex</i>
was driven toward the shore and was finally
brought to anchor within pistol shot of the
beach.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> had but four guns that would shoot
as far as the cannon of the English. The <i>Phoebe</i>
and the <i>Cherub</i> took a position out of range of
nearly all the <i>Essex</i> guns, and then poured broadside
after broadside into the unfortunate vessel.</p>

<p>Captain Porter and his gallant crew fought
against these odds until one hundred and twenty-four
of the men had been killed or wounded.
Then the <i>Essex</i> surrendered.</p>

<p>During all this dreadful battle there was no
braver officer than the little midshipman, David  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Farragut. Sometimes he was carrying messages
for the captain; again, he was bringing powder
for the guns.</p>

<p>Once when going down the hatchway a wounded
man fell upon him. David barely escaped being
crushed to death.</p>

<p>Captain Porter was so pleased with his conduct
that he mentioned his bravery in his official dispatches
to the government.</p>

<p>After the surrender the wounded were removed
to shore. David offered his services to the surgeons.
He worked early and late, preparing
bandages and waiting upon the injured men.</p>

<p>In speaking of this afterward, he said, "I never
earned Uncle Sam's money so faithfully."</p>

<p>The British put all the American prisoners on
board an unarmed vessel, and made them promise
that they would not take up arms against the
English until they had been exchanged for an
equal number of English prisoners.</p>

<p>After this the Americans were allowed to sail
for the United States. They arrived in the harbor
of New York on July 7, 1814.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Trip on the Mediterranean.</span></h3>

<p>Although a prisoner of war, David Farragut was
glad to get back to the United States.</p>

<p>While waiting to be exchanged he attended a
school in Chester, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It was a strange school. The pupils had no
books. The teacher, Mr. Neif, told them the
things he wished them to learn, and the boys
wrote them down in notebooks. They would
sometimes be examined on these notes to see
whether they had paid proper attention.</p>

<p>In the afternoons, Mr. Neif would take the boys
for long walks. They made collections of minerals
and plants, and learned many curious and useful
facts about them.</p>

<p>Mr. Neif, who had been a soldier, gave the boys
military drill. He also taught them to swim and
climb.</p>

<p>David Farragut was not a handsome boy. But
people liked to look at him, for his face was honest
and good. He was short for his years, but he
stood very erect, and held his head as high as he
could.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot afford to lose any of my inches,"
he said.</p>

<p>In November, 1814, the British and the Americans
made an exchange of prisoners, and David
Farragut was now free to return to the navy.
As a treaty of peace was made a few weeks
later, he did not have to serve against the British.</p>

<p>During the next two years, David made but one
short cruise. He was quartered, the rest of the
time, on a receiving ship. This is a vessel stationed
at the navy yards, where recruits are first
received into the service.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1816, David went on a cruise
that proved to be most interesting. He was
ordered to the <i>Washington</i>, a beautiful new ship
of seventy-four guns. This was to carry the
American minister to Naples, in Italy.</p>

<p>While waiting at Annapolis for the minister they
had a visit from the President, James Madison.
Among his suite was Captain Porter, who was
then a naval commissioner. He came to say
good-bye to David.</p>

<p>The voyage across the Atlantic was one to be  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
remembered. The captain was very proud of his
"crack" ship. He kept the crew so busy cleaning
decks and scouring "bright work," that sometimes
they had no food for eight hours at a time. Once
all the crew were kept on deck for several nights
in succession.</p>

<p>During the summer months, the <i>Washington</i>
cruised about the Mediterranean, stopping at
many places. This was a wonderful experience
for David. He visited the bay of Naples. The
great volcano, Vesuvius, was then in eruption,
and the sight of this alone was worth the voyage.</p>

<p>While in the bay, the king of Naples and the
emperor of Austria made a visit to the <i>Washington</i>,
and a grand display was made to entertain
them.</p>

<p>The <i>Washington</i> stopped at the coast towns of
Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers, and finally wintered in
a Spanish harbor. The Spaniards were very kind
to the captain. They allowed him to use their
navy yard, in which to refit his vessel.</p>

<p>During all this cruise, the boys on the ship were
taught by the chaplain, Mr. Folsom.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>He was very fond of David, and in the autumn
of 1817, when he was appointed consul to Tunis,
he wrote to the captain of the <i>Washington</i> for
permission to take David with him.</p>

<p>This request was granted, and David spent a
delightful year with his old friend. He studied
mathematics and English literature. He also
learned to speak French and Italian.</p>

<p>He and Mr. Folsom took many trips about the
Mediterranean, and these were of great benefit to
him. In October, 1818, he returned to the <i>Washington</i>,
in which he cruised for another year.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">War with the Pirates.</span></h3>

<p>While David Farragut was at a port in the
Mediterranean, he was summoned to America to
take his examination for the lieutenancy. He was
then eighteen years of age.</p>

<p>In November, 1820, he arrived in New York,
where he passed his examination successfully. He
did not receive any appointment, however, for some
time, as there were no vacancies in the navy.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The next two years were spent with the Porter
family at Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1822, he sailed for a short time on a sloop of
war, that was cruising about the Gulf of Mexico.
On his return to America, he learned that Captain
Porter was fitting out a fleet to cruise against the
pirates of the West Indies.</p>

<p>These robbers had small, fast-sailing ships.
They would attack unarmed merchant vessels,
seize all the valuables they could carry away, and
destroy the remainder. Sometimes they killed
the crew; at other times they put them ashore on
some desert island.</p>

<p>For years, Americans and English had been
waging war against these pirates, but without success.
With their small boats the robbers would
run into the shallow bays and creeks, where no
other vessels could follow them; and so they had
grown bolder and bolder every year.</p>

<p>Ever since peace had been declared with England,
Captain Porter had been a commissioner of
the navy, and had made no sea voyages. But
now he offered to resign his position, and drive  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the pirates from the sea. He said he would do
this upon one condition. He must have a fleet of
small vessels that could follow the pirates into
their lurking places.</p>

<p>The government accepted his offer, and gave
him orders to fit out such a fleet as he chose.
He bought eight small schooners similar to those
used by the pirates. To these were added five
large rowboats or barges, which were called the
Mosquito Fleet. David Farragut was assigned
to one of the vessels named the <i>Greyhound</i>.</p>

<p>This fleet of Captain Porter's had many encounters
with the pirates. At one time, when the
<i>Greyhound</i> was off the southern coast of Cuba,
some of the crew went on shore to hunt game,
and were fired upon from the thicket by pirates.
The Americans returned this fire without effect,
and then went back to their ship.</p>

<p>Young Farragut was ordered to take a party of
men to capture the pirates, and at three o'clock the
next morning they set out in the barges.</p>

<p>After landing, David and his men tried to go
around to a point at the rear of the place where  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the pirates were supposed to be. This was no easy
thing to do. They had to cut their way through
thickets of cactus, thorny bushes, and trailing
vines. Their shoes were cut from their feet
with walking over the sharp rocks; and the heat
was so intense that some of the men fainted.</p>

<p>At last they found the pirate camp. It was
deserted. The robbers had seen the <i>Greyhound</i>
and the barges, and had fled to some other hiding
place. In the camp, which was protected by
several cannon, there were some houses a hundred
feet long. There was also an immense cave filled
with all kinds of goods taken from plundered
vessels.</p>

<p>The sailors burned the houses, and carried the
plunder and cannon to their boats. The prize
that David himself took away was a monkey,
which he had captured after a fierce struggle.</p>

<p>As the sailors were returning to their boats, they
heard a great noise in the thicket behind them, and
thought that the pirates had come back to attack
them. David Farragut made a speech to his men.
He urged them to stand their ground and fight  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
bravely. Imagine their surprise and amusement
at finding their foes to be thousands of land crabs,
making their way through the briars!</p>

<p>This was only one of many encounters that the
Mosquito Fleet had with the pirates. Through all
the time, the American sailors suffered much from
yellow fever and exposure. David Farragut afterward
said: "I never owned a bed during my cruise
in the West Indies, but lay down to rest wherever
I found the most comfortable berth."</p>

<p>The pirates were finally driven from the seas.
Their boats were burned or captured, and their
camps destroyed.</p>

<p>While on this cruise, David got leave of absence
to visit his sister in New Orleans. She was the
only one of the family still living at the old home.
It was hard for her to recognize in the stranger
the boy who had left home so long before.</p>

<p>When young Farragut was on his way to the
north and within sight of Washington, he was
taken ill with yellow fever. He had nursed many
a poor sailor, and had hitherto escaped the disease.</p>

<p>After a short time spent in a Washington hospital,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
he was able to return home. Soon afterward,
he was married in Norfolk, Virginia, to
Susan Marchant. But it was nearly two years
before he was entirely well, and strong enough
to resume his duties in the navy. In the meanwhile,
he and his bride spent much time with the
family of Captain Porter.</p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">From Lieutenant to Captain.</span></h3>

<p>In August, 1825, David Farragut at last received
his commission as lieutenant. He was ordered
on board the ship <i>Brandywine</i>, the vessel which
was to have the honor of taking the Marquis de
Lafayette to France.</p>

<p>This great Frenchman had always been a warm
friend of the United States. Fifty years before,
he had taken a leading part in the Revolutionary
War, and had been one of General Washington's
most trusted officers.</p>

<p>After the Revolution, he had returned to his
home in sunny France. He had always loved
America, and in his old age he felt that he  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
would like to visit again the great nation which
he had helped to establish. So in 1824, though
old and gray, he had come back to America as
the honored guest of the nation.</p>

<p>From one end of the land to the other, his
tour had been one grand ovation.
And now that he was to return
home, the good ship <i>Brandywine</i>
was detailed to carry him
safely across the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/156lafayette.png" width="225" height="273" alt="LAFAYETTE." title="" />
<span class="caption">LAFAYETTE.</span>
</div>

<p>The voyage was an uneventful
one for Lieutenant Farragut.
After landing Lafayette in
France, the <i>Brandywine</i> cruised about the shores
of England and in the waters of the Mediterranean
for about a year.</p>

<p>On his return to America, Lieutenant Farragut
found that his wife was in very poor health, and
he obtained leave of absence from the navy, in
order that he might take her to a famous doctor
in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>

<p>During his stay in that city, he regularly attended
the lectures at Yale College, for David  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Farragut never wasted an opportunity for self-improvement.
When his wife was better, they
returned to Norfolk, where he was placed in charge
of the receiving ship in the navy yard.</p>

<p>Most of the boys on the ship were uneducated
and did not know one letter from another. Lieutenant
Farragut therefore established a school on
board. This proved to be of great value to these
poor boys.</p>

<p>One boy had run away from home to avoid
going to school, and he was determined that he
would not study. It was only after many severe
punishments that he was conquered. When once
started in the right direction, he learned rapidly.</p>

<p>One day, seven years afterward, a fine-looking,
well-dressed man stopped David Farragut on the
street. On being asked his name, the stranger
replied, "I have grown probably a foot since we
parted, but do you not remember the boy who
once gave you so much trouble?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said Farragut, "but I should never
have recognized him in you."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said the stranger, "I am the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
same, and am ready to acknowledge you the
greatest benefactor and friend I ever had in this
world of trouble."</p>

<p>After leaving the receiving ship, Lieutenant
Farragut spent the next ten years in short cruises
along the South American coast and about the
Gulf of Mexico. During all this time his wife was
an invalid, and her health continued to fail until
her death in 1840.</p>

<p>For two years before her death, Lieutenant
Farragut was at home on leave of absence. He
could then be constantly with her and wait upon
her.</p>

<p>In speaking of his devotion to his wife, a lady in
Norfolk said: "When Lieutenant Farragut dies,
every woman in the city should bring a stone, and
build for him a monument reaching to the
skies."</p>

<p>In 1841 promotion came to Farragut, and he
received a commission as commander in the navy.</p>

<p>In 1845, the state of Texas was annexed to the
United States. This brought about a dispute
with Mexico concerning the southwestern boundary  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of the state, and the result was a short war,
in which the Americans were victorious.</p>

<p>Commander Farragut was very anxious to serve
his country in this Mexican War, and wrote many
letters to the Navy Department, asking for the
command of a ship. For a long time he waited
in vain. When, at last, a vessel was assigned to
him, it was too late for him to do his country any
service. The war was about over, and there was
no more work for the navy to do.</p>

<p>From 1850 until 1852, he was employed in
Washington, drawing up a book of regulations
for the navy. As when in New Haven he had
attended the lectures
of Yale College, so
now he attended
those of the Smithsonian
Institution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/159smithsonian.png" width="450" height="299" alt="SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION." title="" />
<span class="caption">SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.</span>
</div>

<p>"I have made it
a rule of my life to
do all things with a
view to the possible future. You cannot come
away from such lectures without being wiser than  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
when you went in," he said. When the book of
regulations was finished, he went back to the navy
yard at Norfolk, where he gave a series of lectures
on gunnery to the officers.</p>

<p>About this time, England and France were at
war with Russia. Farragut applied to Congress
for permission to visit the English and French
fleets engaged in this war. He wished to see
whether he could learn of any improvements that
could be made in the American navy.</p>

<p>But Congress had other work for him to do.
There was to be a new navy yard built on the
Pacific coast, at San Francisco. This would be a
difficult task, and one requiring the services of a
man having great knowledge and experience. No
one was better fitted to undertake it than the
lieutenant who had been so eager to make use of
every opportunity for improvement.</p>

<p>In August, 1854, he was accordingly sent to
California. Some time before this, he had married
a second wife, Virginia Loyall, of Norfolk, and
she accompanied him to the Pacific coast. There
were then no railroads across the great western  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
plains, and they went by ship to the isthmus of
Panama. After crossing the isthmus, they embarked
upon a coasting vessel, and sailed to San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Commander Farragut spent four years in laying
the foundations of what is to-day the great navy
yard on Mare Island, about thirty miles from
San Francisco.</p>

<p>Before this work was completed he was promoted
to the rank of captain. This was, at that time, the
highest rank in the United States navy.</p>

<p>In July, 1858, Captain Farragut returned home.
He was given, at once, the command of the <i>Brooklyn</i>.
It had been ten years since he had been on
a war vessel, and he found many changes. His
ship had steam power as well as sails. It was
one of the first steam war vessels built for the
navy.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the guns was the same as
in the old sailing sloops. But they were much
larger, and of different shape. Explosive shells
were used instead of solid cannon balls.</p>

<p>The <i>Brooklyn</i> cruised for two years in the Atlantic  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and the Gulf of Mexico. While on this cruise,
Captain Farragut again visited New Orleans, for
he wished to see his brother who was on duty at
the naval station there. A sorrowful welcome
awaited him, however, for his brother had died
just before his arrival. The captain sadly returned
to his ship, and soon afterward sailed home to
Norfolk.</p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Question of Allegiance.</span></h3>

<p>In 1861, at the beginning of the Civil War, the
United States navy had but ninety vessels of all
kinds. Twenty-one of these were not fit for service.
Only eleven of those in commission were in
American waters. The rest, which were scattered
all over the world, were recalled at once.</p>

<p>Some of those in far away ports were commanded
by southern captains, and it would take
them several months to reach America.</p>

<p>It was feared that they would take their vessels
into southern ports, and turn them over to the
Confederate government. These fears, however,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
were groundless, for all the vessels were safely
brought into northern ports. With few exceptions,
all the naval officers were loyal to the United
States.</p>

<p>Of all these naval officers, none was more loyal
than Captain Farragut. In his home in Virginia,
he had watched the growing troubles with a sad
heart. He was a southerner by birth, and his most
tender ties were in Virginia. It was there that he
had spent many years with the Porter family, and
there he had numerous friends. It was there, also,
that he had married and made his home.</p>

<p>He knew that, should war break out, he would be
called upon to choose between his friends in the
South, and his government in the North.</p>

<p>"God forbid," he said, "that I should have to
raise my hand against the South." These very
words showed that his decision had been made.</p>

<p>He felt that he owed his first allegiance to the
United States government, which had given him
his education, employment, and rank. He could
not take up arms against the flag of his country.
It was under this flag that he had received his first  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
commission as midshipman. In that proud moment
he had taken his oath to die in its defense.</p>

<p>On the ocean, he had seen the proudest colors
lowered to the victorious stars and stripes. At
Valparaiso, he had stood on the bloody deck of
the <i>Essex</i>, and had seen men give their lives in
order that the flag should not be hauled down.
He had traveled from ocean to ocean, and had
seen the star spangled banner respected by all
nations.</p>

<p>For some weeks before the actual beginning of
war, there was much excitement in Norfolk. Every
day the men met together in the stores to talk
over the latest news, and there were many lively
discussions among them. In these meetings, Captain
Farragut boldly asserted his loyalty to the
government, and this caused him the loss of many
of his friends.</p>

<p>One morning, when in discussion with some
officers, one of them said to him, "A person of
your sentiments cannot live in Norfolk."</p>

<p>"Well, then," he calmly replied, "I can live
somewhere else."  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt that the time for action had come. He
went home at once, and told his wife that he was
going to "stick to the flag," and that they must
move to the North.</p>

<p>With sad hearts, they sailed away from Norfolk.</p>

<p>They went to New York, and made their home
on the Hudson, in a town called Hastings.</p>

<p>Even there, Captain Farragut met with a cold
reception. The people were suspicious of the
southern officer who had come to live among them.
They did not consider the great sacrifice that he
had made in leaving home and friends.</p>

<p>Determined to do his duty, he wrote to offer his
services to the government. Congress could not,
at once, accept them. No minor position could be
given to Captain Farragut; it must be one full of
responsibility.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, until the government
had need of his services. The Mississippi River
separated two large sections of the southern
states, and its control was of the greatest importance
to both the North and the South.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war, all the river from  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Cairo, Illinois, to the Gulf, was controlled by the
South. The capture of the upper forts in this
section was first attempted by the North.</p>

<p>Large armies marched against them by land,
and a fleet of river gunboats sailed down from the
north to assist them. These gunboats were river
steamers which the government had covered with
plates of iron and armed with cannon.</p>

<p>While the northern river forts were thus being attacked,
an expedition was planned to capture the
fortifications near the river's mouth.</p>

<p>The strongest of these were Fort Jackson and
Fort St. Philip. These were between New Orleans
and the Gulf of Mexico, and their capture
would give New Orleans to the North. This was
considered a very important undertaking.</p>

<p>After much discussion, the Navy Department
decided that Captain Farragut was best fitted to
command this expedition. So Commander David
D. Porter was sent to Hastings to talk the matter
over with him. This commander was the son of
the Captain Porter who had adopted David Farragut
when a boy.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>When Captain Farragut heard of the proposed
expedition he was very enthusiastic. He hurried at
once to Washington, where he was appointed commander
of the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron.
This was in January, 1862. His orders
were to capture Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and
take New Orleans.</p>

<p>A few weeks before this an event took place
which came near making serious trouble for the
United States. The Confederate government had
appointed two commissioners, John Slidell and
James Mason, to go to England to see if they
could not get help from that country.</p>

<p>As it would be dangerous for them to sail in a
Confederate vessel, they went to Havana, Cuba,
where they took passage in an English vessel
named the <i>Trent</i>.</p>

<p>Although they had tried to do this very secretly,
Captain Wilkes, commanding a warship of the
United States, heard about it, and determined to
capture these men, if possible. So he pursued
the <i>Trent</i> and obliged her to stop.</p>

<p>The Confederate commissioners refused to leave  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the <i>Trent</i>, and, therefore, Captain Wilkes sent an
armed force on board and carried them off. He
then took them to Boston harbor, where they were
imprisoned in a fort of the United States.</p>

<p>This act caused great indignation in England,
and it was only through the prompt and wise
action of President Lincoln and Congress that
war was averted. An apology was made and the
Confederate commissioners were allowed to proceed
on their voyage without further molestation.</p>


<h3>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Capture of New Orleans.</span></h3>

<p>On the 2d of February, 1862, Captain Farragut
sailed from Hampton Roads in his flagship, the
<i>Hartford</i>. This was one of the new sloops of war
having both steam and sails.</p>

<p>All the vessels of this expedition were to meet
at Ships Island, about one hundred miles from
the mouth of the Mississippi. When Captain
Farragut arrived there on February 20th, he found
only a part of his fleet awaiting him. The other
vessels arrived one by one.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the most powerful squadron that had
ever been under an American commander. It
consisted of steam sloops, gunboats, and mortar
boats, forty-eight vessels in all.</p>

<p>An army of fifteen thousand men was at hand
to assist Captain Farragut. This army had been
brought from the North on transports, and was
under the
command of
General Benjamin
F. Butler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/169hartford.png" width="400" height="213" alt="THE HARTFORD." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE HARTFORD.</span>
</div>

<p>In the channel,
at the
mouth of the
Mississippi,
were heavy mud banks, made of deposits brought
down by the stream. To take the large vessels
over this bar was Captain Farragut's first great
task. The water was so shallow that the keels
of the ships would sometimes stick in the mud,
and then it was with the greatest of difficulty that
they could be hauled off.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the 18th of April before all the vessels
were in the river and ready to attack the forts;
and in the meanwhile, a great naval battle had
been fought in other waters.</p>

<p>The Confederates had captured the Norfolk
navy yard, and with it the United States vessel
<i>Merrimac</i>, which was there at the time. They
removed the masts of this vessel, and then
fitted her with an iron prow, and built sloping
sides over the deck, covering them with iron rails
laid closely together side by side.</p>

<p>Five of the best Northern war vessels lay in the
bay outside of the harbor.</p>

<p>On March 8th, 1862, the <i>Merrimac</i> attacked
this fleet. She drove her iron prow straight
through the side of the <i>Cumberland</i>. This vessel
sank almost immediately, and but few of the men
were saved.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Merrimac</i> attacked the <i>Congress</i>,
drove her ashore, and set her on fire with red hot
shot. Meanwhile, broadside after broadside had
been fired at the <i>Merrimac</i>; but the shot bounded
harmlessly from her sloping iron sides.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Night came on, and before attempting to
destroy the other three ships, the black monster
waited for the daylight.</p>

<p>There was consternation all through the North.
How could a stop be made to this fearful work
of the <i>Merrimac</i>? There was no telling what she
might do on the morrow.</p>

<p>That same night there steamed
into Chesapeake Bay a queer looking
little vessel which had been
built by a famous mechanic, Captain
John Ericsson. She was
named the <i>Monitor</i>. She had a
low, flat deck, pointed at both
ends. In the center was a round, revolving turret.
The vessel was completely plated over with iron,
and in the turret were two enormous guns, larger
than any that had ever been used before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/171confedflag.png" width="225" height="328" alt="CONFEDERATE FLAG." title="" />
<span class="caption">CONFEDERATE FLAG.</span>
</div>

<p>On the morning of March 9th, when the <i>Merrimac</i>
steamed out to finish her work of destruction,
a stupendous cannon ball came thundering
against her black side. As the turret of the little
<i>Monitor</i> swung round, there came another and  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
another,&mdash;such a battering as never ship's side had
felt before that day.</p>

<p>The broadsides returned by the <i>Merrimac</i> fell
harmlessly on the flat deck and iron turret of the
<i>Monitor</i>.</p>

<p>This battle lasted for nearly three hours.
Neither vessel was injured to any extent. Finally
the <i>Merrimac</i> withdrew, leaving the <i>Monitor</i> in
possession of the bay.</p>

<p>In one respect, this was the most wonderful
battle ever fought upon the water. It showed to
all the nations of the world that new navies must
be built. In one day all the war-ships in the world
had become old-fashioned. The days for wooden
war vessels were over.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Captain Farragut. As I
have said, by the 18th of April he had succeeded
in taking all his vessels over the bar of the Mississippi.
But still greater difficulties were ahead of
him.</p>

<p>Before he could capture New Orleans, he must
pass the two forts, Jackson and St. Philip, on
opposite banks of the river. First of all, however,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
he must break through a
barricade which was below
the forts. This reached
from shore to shore, and
was made of old hulks of
vessels and cypress logs,
fastened together with huge
iron chains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/173map.png" width="400" height="549" alt="MAP OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI." title="" />
<span class="caption">MAP OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.</span>
</div>

<p>Should the barricade be
broken and the forts
passed, there was still a
Confederate fleet to be
overcome. This consisted
of fifteen ships, gunboats,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and steam rams similar to the <i>Merrimac</i>. They
were drawn up across the river above the forts.
Captain Farragut was not discouraged by any of
these things, but began at once to carry out his
plans.</p>

<p>All along the banks of the river were thick
woods. The forts themselves were almost hidden
by the trees. Captain Farragut stationed
his mortar boats close to the banks, below the
chain barricade; and, in order that they might be
better hidden from the forts, large branches of
trees had been tied to the tops of the masts.</p>

<p>This mortar flotilla was commanded by Captain
Porter. The mortars could throw thirteen-inch
shells for a distance of two miles.</p>

<p>Captain Farragut's plan was to send these mortar
boats forward to bombard the forts, while the
other vessels, breaking through the chains, should
sail boldly up the river.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 18th, the shells from
the mortars began to rain down upon the forts.
For six days and nights this firing never ceased.
The answering shots from the forts did but little  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
harm. The Confederates could not take aim at
boats which they could not see.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, two of Captain Farragut's gunboats
crept up the river at night, and broke a passage
through the chain barricade. Then, on the night
of April 23d, the entire fleet sailed through this
opening and boldly attacked the forts.</p>

<p>The whole river was at once a scene of confusion.
Every gun, both of the forts and of the
Confederate fleet, which had hastened down the
river, was sending shot and shell into the Union
fleet.</p>

<p>The Confederates piled every kind of inflammable
material upon huge rafts, set them on fire,
and sent them floating down the river. They
hoped, in this way, to burn the invading fleet.
The river was a blaze of light. The din from the
cannon was terrible.</p>

<p>But Captain Farragut and his vessels kept
steadily on. They passed the forts, and destroyed
or captured every vessel in the Confederate fleet.
This was accomplished with the loss of but one
ship of the Union squadron.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>When the news of this victory reached New
Orleans, the whole city was thrown into wild confusion.
Men, women, and children rushed to the
levee and set fire to the goods there.</p>

<p>Everything that would burn was set on fire, and
sent down the river to meet
the victorious fleet that was
coming. Ships loaded with
burning cotton, and even a
half-finished ram like the
<i>Merrimac</i> floated down
stream, a mass of flames.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/176butler.png" width="225" height="287" alt="GENERAL B.F. BUTLER." title="" />
<span class="caption">GENERAL B.F. BUTLER.</span>
</div>

<p>About noon on April
25th, the fleet rounded the
bend of the river, and came
in sight of the city. That
same morning, the mayor of New Orleans had
ordered the state flag of Louisiana to be hoisted
upon the city hall.</p>

<p>Captain Farragut demanded that this should
be hauled down. He also ordered that the stars
and stripes should be raised over the buildings
belonging to the United States government.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Commander Porter with his mortar
boats had been steadily bombarding Fort Jackson
and Fort St. Philip. On April 28th, these forts
surrendered, and the Union forces took possession.</p>

<p>On the following day, the flag of the United
States was floating over the city hall of New
Orleans. General Butler and his troops took possession
of the city on the first of May.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July, on the recommendation of
President Lincoln, Congress passed a resolution
thanking Captain Farragut for what he had done;
and a few days later he was further rewarded by
being raised to the rank of rear-admiral.</p>


<h3>IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Battle of Mobile Bay.</span></h3>

<p>After the capture of New Orleans, Admiral
Farragut was ordered at once to proceed up the
river. He was to pass, or to attack and capture,
all the Confederate forts between New Orleans
and Memphis.</p>

<p>But for many reasons, he thought it unwise to
attempt this expedition.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The increasing shallowness of the river would
make it almost impossible to use his best sea-going
vessels. The upper forts were located on
high bluffs, and it would be difficult to attack them
from the river.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut knew
that, should he be able to
pass these forts, or even to
silence their guns, he could
not hold them without a
large land force. But he
was too good a soldier to
do anything in disobedience
to orders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/178banks.png" width="225" height="276" alt="GENERAL N.P. BANKS." title="" />
<span class="caption">GENERAL N.P. BANKS.</span>
</div>

<p>In the face of all these
difficulties, he passed and repassed the forts at
Vicksburg and Port Hudson. He made it plain
to the Confederates that none of their batteries
on the Mississippi could stop the movements of
his fleet. But he found, as he had expected, that
the forts could not be held until armies came to his
assistance.</p>

<p>A large land force under General Grant besieged  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Vicksburg until it surrendered on July 4, 1863.
Five days later, an army under General Nathaniel
P. Banks succeeded in capturing Port Hudson.</p>

<p>These were the last Confederate strongholds on
the Mississippi. Their capture
gave to the Union
forces the entire control of
the river.</p>

<p>The command of the
Mississippi squadron was
given to David D. Porter,
who had likewise been rewarded
with the rank of rear
admiral. He took charge
of all the river boats of the
fleet, while Farragut, with most of the sea-going
vessels, sailed for the Atlantic coast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/179porter.png" width="225" height="286" alt="ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER." title="" />
<span class="caption">ADMIRAL DAVID D. PORTER.</span>
</div>

<p>These vessels were all in need of repairs. His
flagship, the <i>Hartford</i>, which was in the best condition
of all, had two hundred and forty scars from
shot and shell.</p>

<p>After the loss of New Orleans, Mobile was the
best Gulf port left to the Confederates. This city  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
stands at the head of the broad, shallow bay of
Mobile, thirty miles from the Gulf.</p>

<p>The entrance to the bay is very narrow, and it
was protected by two strong forts,&mdash;Fort Morgan
on one side, and Fort Gaines on the other.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut was ordered to capture these
forts. This would prevent the South from using
the port of Mobile.</p>

<p>On January 18th, 1864, his ships having been
repaired, Captain Farragut sailed again into the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>He was anxious to make the attack early in the
spring, but it was August before his fleet was
ready.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Confederates had made
their fortifications stronger. The only channel
through which the vessels could pass was near
Fort Morgan. The Confederates strengthened
this fort with every defense possible.</p>

<p>A double line of torpedoes, or submarine mines,
was stretched across the channel. Above this, lay
the Confederate fleet. One of these vessels, the
<i>Tennessee</i>, was a huge iron ram like the <i>Merrimac</i>.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>The squadron of Admiral Farragut was a strong
one. There were twenty-four wooden war vessels
and four ironclads like the <i>Monitor</i>.</p>

<p>On the night of August 4th, every preparation
was made for the attack. The seamen, with
determined faces, gave their messages and keep-sakes
to their messmates, for they hardly expected
to come out of this fray alive.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut, himself, made all his arrangements
for the worst, though hoping for the best.
He wrote to his wife, "I am going into Mobile in
the morning, if God is my leader, as I hope He
is, and in Him I place my trust. If He thinks it
is the place for me to die, I am ready to submit to
His will. God bless and preserve you, if anything
should happen to me."</p>

<p>At sunrise the fleet moved steadily toward Fort
Morgan, the stars and stripes flying from every
masthead.</p>

<p>The four ironclads were sent ahead, close to the
forts. The wooden war vessels followed, lashed
together in pairs. This was done so that if one
vessel became disabled it could be towed by the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
other. Farragut wished to lead the fleet in his
flagship, the <i>Hartford</i>, but his officers dissuaded
him, and the <i>Brooklyn</i> went first, the <i>Hartford</i> following.</p>

<p>The admiral climbed up in the rigging, where he
could command a view of the entire fleet. As the
shells from the forts began to fall about the vessels,
he climbed higher and higher, in order to see
above the smoke.</p>

<p>Fearing that a shot would cut the ropes, one of
his officers climbed up to him and wound a rope
around his body. The end of this was secured to
the mast.</p>

<p>The ironclad <i>Tecumseh</i> was now leading the
fleet. Suddenly there was a muffled explosion.
The stern of the <i>Tecumseh</i> rose out of the water
and she plunged bow foremost to the bottom of
the channel.</p>

<p>At this, the <i>Brooklyn</i> stopped, and with reversed
engines began to back water. Admiral Farragut
signaled, and asked, "What's the trouble?"
"Torpedoes," was the reply.</p>

<p>This was the critical moment of the battle.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
The backing of the <i>Brooklyn</i> caused confusion
among the vessels following so closely upon each
other. There was tremendous cheering and
firing from the Confederates. They were sure
that the victory was theirs.</p>

<p>A signal was made to the <i>Brooklyn</i> to go ahead,
but she remained motionless.</p>

<p>What should be done? To remain there, under
the guns of the fort, with the other vessels coming
up behind, was out of the question. Ahead lay
the dreaded line of torpedoes. Everything depended
upon prompt decision.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut ordered the <i>Hartford</i> to go
ahead, "full speed." She passed the <i>Brooklyn</i>,
and made straight for the mines that had sunk the
<i>Tecumseh</i>. As they crossed the line of torpedoes,
the sailors could hear them grating against the
hull of the vessel. None of them exploded, however,
and the <i>Hartford</i> passed the fatal line in
safety.</p>

<p>The effect of this daring deed was wonderful.
Men sprang to the guns, and the air was filled
with the roar of cannon. The other vessels all  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
followed the <i>Hartford</i> across the torpedoes, into
the bay. They then attacked the Confederate
fleet, and soon either captured or destroyed all but
the ram <i>Tennessee</i>. This vessel had taken refuge
under the guns of Fort
Morgan.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut then
anchored about four miles
up the bay. While his
men were having breakfast
the iron ram steamed
out boldly from the fort
to attack the whole fleet.</p>

<p>Admiral Buchanan, the
commander of the Confederate
fleet, was a brave officer. Not until after
a fierce combat, which lasted over an hour, was he
forced to surrender the <i>Tennessee</i>.</p>

<p>This ended the battle of Mobile Bay. "It was
one of the hardest earned victories of my life,
and the most desperate battle I ever fought since
the days of the <i>Essex</i>," said Farragut.</p>

<p>Not quite three hours had passed from the time  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that Fort Morgan fired its first gun until the
<i>Tennessee</i> surrendered.</p>

<p>With the Confederate fleet destroyed, and
Mobile Bay in possession of Farragut, the forts
were soon captured.</p>

<p>While Farragut had been
winning these victories in
the Gulf, a very brilliant
naval battle had been
fought off the coast of
France.</p>

<p>During the whole of the
war, England had allowed
the Confederates to fit out
armed cruisers in her harbors, and to send them
out to prey upon the United States commerce.
The most famous of these cruisers was the
<i>Alabama</i>, commanded by Captain Raphael
Semmes. For two years this vessel had roamed
the sea, burning and destroying nearly forty
United States merchantmen, but always eluding
the war vessels.</p>

<p>At last, in June, 1864, the United States war  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
vessel <i>Kearsarge</i> discovered this enemy in the
harbor of Cherbourg, France. As it would have
been against the laws of nations to fight a battle
in the harbor, the <i>Kearsarge</i> remained outside to
prevent the <i>Alabama</i> from getting away.</p>

<p>Finally on Sunday, June 19th, the <i>Alabama</i>
suddenly put to sea and attacked the <i>Kearsarge</i>.
The vessels were evenly matched.</p>

<p>The battle following was terrific. But the crew
of the <i>Kearsarge</i> proved to be the better marksmen,
and after an hour's furious fighting the
<i>Alabama</i> suddenly gave a great lurch and plunged
to the bottom of the ocean: The crew were picked
up by the <i>Kearsarge</i> and some English vessels
which happened to be near.</p>


<h3>X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Well-earned Laurels.</span></h3>

<p>After the surrender of the forts, Farragut remained
in Mobile Bay until the following November.
His health was suffering from his labors
and the effects of the southern climate.</p>

<p>At this time, the Navy Department requested  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
him to take command of an expedition against
Fort Fisher. This greatly disturbed him, and he
wrote to the Secretary of the Navy that his
strength was exhausted.</p>

<p>"I am willing," he said, "to do the bidding of
the government as long as I am able. I fear, however,
that my health is giving way. I have now
been down to the Gulf five years out of six, and I
want rest if it is to be had."</p>

<p>When the Secretary of the Navy realized the
condition of his health, Admiral Farragut was
granted the much needed furlough.</p>

<p>Leaving his squadron in charge of an efficient
officer, he sailed north in November, 1864. As
his flagship entered New York harbor, it was met
by a committee of city officials and citizens.
Enthusiastic crowds greeted him as he landed, and
a reception in his honor was held at the custom-house.</p>

<p>A few days later, a committee of citizens sent
him a request to make his home in New York.
With this request came a gift of $50,000. In
December, Congress created for him the grade  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of vice-admiral. All these honors were gratefully
and modestly acknowledged by him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1865 peace was declared, and
Admiral Farragut went for a visit to Norfolk. He
found that many of his old acquaintances still felt
very unfriendly towards him for having taken up
arms against the South. Although this pained him
deeply, he said that he had never regretted having
done his duty.</p>

<p>In 1866, the government gave him the title of
Admiral. This title made him commander of the
whole American navy. It was a rank created
especially for him. The government could give
him no higher honor.</p>

<p>In 1867, he was appointed commander of the
European squadron. Without any request from
him, the government sent permission for Mrs.
Farragut to accompany him on this cruise. On
June 28th, they sailed from New York on the
steam frigate <i>Franklin</i>.</p>

<p>This foreign cruise was more like the triumphal
progress of a king than the official visit of a naval
commander. He dined with the emperor of  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
France and the queen of England. He visited
the ports of Russia, Holland, and Belgium. He
sailed again through the blue Mediterranean, visiting
the places he had seen on his former cruise.
A special excavation of the buried Pompeii was
made for his benefit. At Malta, a grand reception
was held in his honor.</p>

<p>But most of all, he enjoyed a visit to his father's
Spanish birthplace. This was in the island of
Minorca, just off the eastern coast of Spain.</p>

<p>He was to visit the little city on the day before
Christmas. The news of his coming had spread
rapidly to all parts of the island, and a general
holiday had been proclaimed.</p>

<p>At every village on the way crowds of men and
women came to meet him and bid him welcome.
All along the route soldiers had been stationed to
pay him honor, and give him any assistance that
he might need.</p>

<p>Four miles from the city gates he was met by a
large committee of citizens, and transferred to a
handsome carriage.</p>

<p>The city walls, housetops, and balconies were  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
crowded with men, women, and children. One old
man, with tears streaming down his face, shouted:
"He is ours! He is ours!"</p>

<p>The admiral was entertained at the mansion of
one of the prominent citizens. A band of music
played in the vestibule, while the people came in
crowds.</p>

<p>Early the next day, surrounded by an excited
throng, he was escorted to all the places of interest.
They finally went to the great cathedral, where
the organ pealed forth the American national airs.</p>

<p>This was the last place the admiral visited before
his return to America. He landed in New
York, November 10th, 1868.</p>

<p>The following summer, he made a trip to the
Pacific coast, to visit the navy yard at Mares
Island. You will remember that, years before, he
had laid the foundations of this navy yard.</p>

<p>Returning from San Francisco to the East, he
was taken very ill in Chicago. By careful nursing
he was able to resume the journey. But he never
regained his lost strength, and his health continued
steadily to fail.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The following summer the Navy Department
placed a steamer at his disposal, and with his
family he visited Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>

<p>This was his last sea voyage. As the ship came
into harbor, he arose from his sick bed at the
sound of the salute being fired in his honor.</p>

<p>Dressed in full uniform, he went on deck.
Looking up with a sad smile at his flag flying
from the masthead, he said: "It would be well
if I died <i>now</i> in harness."</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival he wandered on board
a dismantled sloop, lying at the wharf. He looked
about the ship, and, as he left her to go ashore,
he said: "This is the last time I shall ever tread
the deck of a man of war."</p>

<p>This proved to be true. On August 14th, 1870,
surrounded by his family and loving friends, he
died. He was sixty-nine years old.</p>

<p>The government sent a steam frigate to take his
body to New York. On the day of his funeral,
the whole city was in mourning. The buildings
were draped in black. Bells were tolled and
guns fired.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>His body was laid in Woodlawn Cemetery.
Heading the procession was General Grant, then
the President of the United States. Following
were many military and naval officers, and thousands
of soldiers.</p>

<p>The government erected a bronze statue in his
honor. This is in the national capital, in Farragut
Square.</p>

<p>Thus ends the story of the life of America's first
admiral, the story of a man who won fame and
glory by constant effort for self-improvement and
strict adherence to duty.</p>

<h3>FOREWORD.</h3>

<h4>CAUSES OF THE WAR WITH SPAIN.</h4>


<p>On the 23d of April, 1898, war was declared between the
United States and Spain. To understand how this came
about, we must go back a great many years.</p>

<p>Ever since the island of Cuba was discovered by Columbus
in 1492, the one thought of the Spaniards has been to
gain wealth from the island without giving anything in
return.</p>

<p>For many years, most of the Cubans have been little
better off than slaves. They have always been very poor
and have had to do the hard work on the plantations and
in the cities. At best, they have never been able to make
much more than enough to pay the taxes imposed upon
them by the Spanish government.</p>

<p>The island has been ruled by governors sent out from
Spain. Many of these have been very bad men whose
only desire has been to get rich and return home. For a
long time the Cubans have wished to choose their own
governors, and they have frequently tried, by force, to
secure the right to do this.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1868 to 1878, there was a rebellion known as the
"Ten Years' War." But, one by one, the insurgent bands
were scattered and their leaders killed. This war left
Cuba with a heavy debt, and the people poorer than ever.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Spaniards, after this war, was
more cruel and oppressive than before. Fifty thousand
soldiers were sent to the island to preserve peace. The
people were forced to pay for the support of this army,
and the taxes were almost unendurable.</p>

<p>At last, in 1895, some of the Cubans resolved to stand it
no longer. They formed an army whose watchword was
"Cuba Libre," meaning "Free Cuba," and began another
war with Spain.</p>

<p>The Spanish governor, General Campos, tried in vain
to conquer these insurgents, and was finally recalled to
Spain. General Weyler, who was sent in his place, proved
to be a very cruel man.</p>

<p>He surrounded the larger towns with trenches and
barbed wire fences, and built wooden forts or blockhouses
for his soldiers. Into these fortified towns, thousands
upon thousands of poor country people were driven, their
homes having been burned and their fields destroyed.</p>

<p>The sufferings of these poor people were terrible. They
were huddled together in sheds and huts without the means
even of obtaining food. Sometimes several families were
packed into one little palm-leaf hut where they had foul  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
air, foul water, and almost nothing to eat. Thousands of
men, women, and children died from starvation and disease.</p>

<p>General Weyler hoped by these cruel means to starve
the insurgents into submission, but the war went on just as
before. Throughout the island a terrible work of destruction
was carried on by both the insurgents and the Spaniards.
Railroads were destroyed, and buildings and
plantations were burned.</p>

<p>The people of the United States had heard of all these
things, but for a long time did not do anything to stop
them. But when the American consul at Havana, General
Fitzhugh Lee, reported that many Americans were
among the starving, they could endure it no longer. Food
and supplies were sent through the Red Cross Society, and
a little of the suffering was thus relieved.</p>

<p>Matters grew steadily worse in the island until President
McKinley felt obliged to warn the Spanish government
that they must soon end the war. He declared that if
this was not done, the United States would recognize
Cuba as an independent country.</p>

<p>Spain became alarmed at this, and, in October, 1897,
the cruel Weyler was recalled, and General Blanco was
sent in his place. This new governor tried to stop the
war by granting to the Cubans some of the rights they
demanded. He allowed them to hold some of the offices.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
He released the American political prisoners, and set free
the starving country people.</p>

<p>But it was too late. The crops had been destroyed and
the people could not get a living. The Cuban army would
not be satisfied with anything less than independence, and
so the fighting continued.</p>

<span class="caption">THE MAINE.</span>
</div>

<p>At last an event took place which aroused the people of
the United States to a deeper interest in Cuba than before.
The United States battleship <i>Maine</i>, commanded by Captain
C.D. Sigsbee, had been sent on a friendly visit to
Havana. On the 15th of February, 1898, while lying in
the harbor, she was destroyed by a fearful explosion. Two
hundred and sixty-six officers and men were killed.</p>

<p>President McKinley immediately appointed a committee
to find out, if possible, the cause of the disaster. These
men reported that the <i>Maine</i> was destroyed by a submarine
mine; but they could not find out who had placed it in
the harbor or who had exploded it.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>There was intense excitement all over the United States
during this investigation. Senator Proctor and others
went to Cuba to see for themselves if the reports of the
suffering there were true. When they came back, they
told the people what they had seen. Senator John M.
Thurston made a speech in Congress in which he said:</p>

<p>"I never saw so pitiful a
sight as the people at Matanzas.
I can never forget the
hopeless anguish in their eyes.
They did not ask for alms as
we went among them. Men,
women, and children stood
silent, starving. Their only
appeal came from their sad
eyes.</p>

<p>"The government of Spain
has not and will not give a
dollar to save these people. They are being helped by
the charity of the United States. Think of it! We are feeding
these citizens of Spain; we are nursing their sick; and
yet there are people who say that it is right to send food,
but that we must keep hands off. I say that the time has
come when muskets should go with the food."</p>

<span class="caption">CAPTAIN SIGSBEE OF THE MAINE.</span>
</div>

<p>Most of the members of Congress agreed with Senator
Thurston. On the 19th of April, 1898, they passed a resolution  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
authorizing President McKinley to use the army
and navy of the United States to force Spain to abandon
all claim to the island of Cuba.</p>

<p>Spain was not willing to give up her control of the
Cubans, and therefore war was formally declared. It was
only a few days until actual hostilities began.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of the following chapters to relate the
story of the short but decisive struggle which followed.
In that struggle the navy of the United States bore by far
the largest share, and it is therefore of the navy and of the
brave officers who commanded it that we shall have the
most to say.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STORY OF ADMIRAL DEWEY
AND THE NAVY OF 1898.</h2>


<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Battle of Manila.</span></h3>

<p>On the morning of May 1, 1898, in the harbor
of Manila, one of the most remarkable naval victories
in the history of the world was won by the
United States. The Spanish fleet, though superior
in both men and guns, was entirely destroyed,
and hundreds of officers and men were made
prisoners. All this was accomplished by an
American squadron under Commodore George
Dewey, without the loss of a ship or a man.
The way in which it all came about was as follows:</p>

<p>When war was declared between the United
States and Spain, Commodore George Dewey was
at Hong Kong, China, with that part of our navy
which was known as the Asiatic squadron. He
was at once ordered to sail to the Philippines,
and capture or destroy the Spanish fleet there.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
These Philippine Islands are about six hundred
miles southeast of Hong Kong. Their capital and
largest city is Manila, on the island of Luzon.</p>

<p>As Commodore Dewey sailed out of the bay at
Hong Kong, he signaled to his fleet: "Keep
cool and obey orders."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/202map.png" width="400" height="332" alt="MAP OF MANILA BAY." title="" />
<span class="caption">MAP OF MANILA BAY.</span>
</div>

<p>At a little before midnight, on the 30th of April,
the American vessels in single file, led by the
flagship <i>Olympia</i>, steamed between the forts which
guarded the entrance to the bay of Manila.</p>

<p>In order not to be seen from these forts, all the
lights on the vessels were hidden. Silently and  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
steadily the vessels moved on, unseen by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>All of the fleet except the <i>Boston</i> and <i>McCulloch</i>
had passed in safety, when the soot in the smokestack
of the <i>McCulloch</i> caught fire. Instantly
the guns of one of the
Spanish batteries were
turned upon the fleet. The
<i>Boston</i> and <i>McCulloch</i> returned
the fire, but kept
on their way and were
soon out of range, having
received no injury.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/203montojo.png" width="225" height="266" alt="ADMIRAL MONTOJO." title="" />
<span class="caption">ADMIRAL MONTOJO.</span>
</div>

<p>When day broke, Commodore
Dewey found the
entire Spanish fleet drawn up under the protection
of the batteries of the Cavit naval station about
nine miles from the city of Manila. It was commanded
by Admiral Patricio Montojo, one of the
ablest officers in the Spanish service.</p>

<p>At about five o'clock, with the flagship leading,
the Americans bore down upon the Spanish.
Suddenly there was a muffled roar, and a submarine  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
mine exploded. But, in the excitement,
the Spaniards had fired it too soon, and no damage
was done.</p>

<p>This was soon followed by the explosion of
another mine, but again the Spaniards had been
in too great haste, and the <i>Olympia</i> escaped
uninjured.</p>

<p>Although Commodore Dewey did not know but
that many other torpedoes might be in his path,
he never hesitated. He had been in the battle of
Mobile Bay with Farragut, when that brave commander
had sailed boldly over a line of torpedoes.</p>

<p>Soon the guns of the batteries and Spanish fleet
began to pour a storm of shot and shell at the
American squadron. But, as yet, Commodore
Dewey had not fired a gun.</p>

<p>The American sailors were wild with excitement.
They had been by the guns all night,
and were eager to begin the fray. Finally Commodore
Dewey said quietly to the captain of the
<i>Olympia</i>: "You may fire when ready, Gridley."</p>

<p>The flagship was now within range, and suddenly
one of the great guns sent an answering  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
shot. As its echoes went rolling across the waters,
every man in the American fleet joined in the
shout, "Remember the <i>Maine</i>!" These words
were the battle cry at Manila Bay.</p>

<p>Slowly the American vessels steamed by the
Spanish squadron in single file, pouring in deadly
broadsides as they passed. Then turning, they
retraced their course, drawing a little nearer to
the shore. This maneuver was repeated five
times. The marksmanship of the Americans was
wonderful, and at the end of two hours nearly
every ship in the Spanish fleet had either been
sunk or was on fire.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Commodore Dewey decided
to withdraw out of range of the batteries, to
give his men a rest and breakfast, and find what
damage had been done to his own fleet. Imagine
his surprise and joy at finding that not a single
man had been killed, and that his vessels were
scarcely injured.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock the Americans returned to the
attack, soon silenced the forts, and burned or captured
all that remained of the Spanish fleet.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the battle was over, Commodore
Dewey and his men set to work to care for the
wounded Spanish sailors. They treated them
like brothers, doing everything possible for their
comfort.</p>

<p>After taking possession of the arsenal at Cavit,
Commodore Dewey blockaded the port of Manila,
and awaited further orders from the department
of war. He knew that if the city of Manila
could be captured, it would result in the loss,
by the Spaniards, of the entire Philippine group.</p>

<p>These islands form one of the largest groups
in the world, and are so rich and beautiful that
they are called the "Pearls of the Ocean." They
were the most important of the colonial possessions
of Spain.</p>

<p>When the news of the victory reached the
United States, there was great rejoicing all over
the land, and Commodore Dewey was the hero of
the hour. Congress at once gave him a vote of
thanks, and promoted him to the rank of rear
admiral. It also presented him with a beautiful
sword, and gave a medal to each one of his men.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Boyhood of George Dewey.</span></h3>

<p>Who was this George Dewey who won that
famous victory in the Bay of Manila? He was
a native of Vermont, and had spent the greater
part of his life on the sea with the American
navy.</p>

<p>He was born in Montpelier on the day after
Christmas, 1837. Montpelier was a pleasant
place in which to live. There were hills to
climb, and a pretty little river ran through the
fields and gardens behind the Dewey home.
Here George could wade, sail boats, and fish.</p>

<p>Although he was not fond of books, he never
tired of Robinson Crusoe. With his sister Mary
as Friday, he tramped many times over the hills
playing that they were shipwrecked on an island.</p>

<p>Sometimes George's love of adventure got him
into trouble. One day he read how the famous
Hannibal marched, with an immense army, over
the Alps in winter. The winters in Vermont are
very cold, and to the ten-year-old boy the snow-covered
hills around Montpelier were as good as  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the Alps. So, with his sister Mary for an army,
the youthful Hannibal started on his march. The
campaign proved to be too severe for faithful
Mary, and she was sick in bed for a week.</p>

<p>When about eleven years of age, George was
sent, one day, on an errand. As it was a long
distance, he was allowed to take his father's
horse and buggy, and one of his boy friends for
company.</p>

<p>On the way they came to a ford which, though
usually shallow, was swollen with recent rains.
When his companion wished to turn back George
said, "What man has done, man can do," and
drove, full speed, into the river. The buggy,
horse, and boys were soon floundering in the
rapid current.</p>

<p>When the top and box of the buggy began
to float down stream, George never lost his
presence of mind. Commanding his frightened
comrade to follow him, he climbed upon the
horse, and the boys reached the shore in safety.</p>

<p>When he returned home, George did not try
to escape punishment, but administered it to himself  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
by going to bed without any supper. But
when his father came to his room and began to
scold him, he thought it was a little too much.
In his lisping voice he replied: "You ought to
be thankful that my life wath thpared."</p>

<p>But George Dewey did not play all the time.
His father was a good and wise man, and believed
that a thorough education was one of the most
important things of life. He obliged George to go
to school regularly and conduct himself becomingly.</p>

<p>George had an experience in his first school
which he never forgot. The scholars were an
unruly set, and they had proved too much for
several teachers. When, one day, a new master,
Mr. Pangborn, arrived, the boys began as usual
to make trouble. George was directed to perform
some task and he flatly refused. In a moment Mr.
Pangborn seized him and gave him the worst
whipping that he had ever had.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. When he had finished, Mr.
Pangborn marched the unruly George home to his
father, the whole school following in the rear.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
When Dr. Dewey heard the story, he told George
that if Mr. Pangborn's punishment was not sufficient,
he would administer more.</p>

<p>This settled the matter of disobedience for
George. He was too manly a boy not to admire
his fearless teacher. They grew to be great friends,
and when Mr. Pangborn started a school of his
own in Johnson, Vermont, George asked to be
allowed to attend. This request was granted willingly.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dewey as a Naval Cadet.</span></h3>

<p>When George was fifteen years old, he was sent
to a military school at Norwich, Vermont. He
liked the training so well that he decided to try to
get an appointment in the Naval Academy at
Annapolis.</p>

<p>One day he told one of his school fellows,
George Spalding, what he intended to do. "Why,
Dewey," said Spalding, "that is what I am going
to do myself." Spalding received the coveted
appointment, but as he was not able to go, George
went in his place.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>George Spalding became a minister, and when
the news of Admiral Dewey's victory at Manila
reached the United States, he preached a sermon
about it in his church at Syracuse, New York.</p>

<p>The boy who goes to the Naval School at Annapolis
must be ready to work hard with both his
hands and his brain. The discipline is rigid and
no favors are shown or allowances made.</p>

<p>George Dewey was seventeen years old when
he entered the Academy. He was a strong, active
boy, and fond of outdoor sports. He was also a
lad with whom no one could trifle.</p>

<p>One day one of the cadets called him insulting
names. George promptly knocked him down.
Soon afterward another cadet tried to test the
courage of the "new boy," but received a worse
thrashing than the first one had.</p>

<p>The cadets, however, were a manly set, and
they admired George for his courage in defending
his rights. Long before the four years' training
had expired, George was one of the most popular
members of his class. It is greatly to his credit,
that, although study was not naturally easy for  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
him, yet he graduated as the fifth in his class.
This, at Annapolis, means good honest work.</p>

<p>George was graduated in 1858, and in order to
finish his training, went on a two years' cruise to
the Mediterranean in the <i>Wabash</i>. On his return,
he visited his old home in Montpelier, and while
there the war between the Union and the Southern
Confederacy began. He hurried to Washington,
where he received his commission as lieutenant.</p>


<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">From Lieutenant to Commodore.</span></h3>

<p>Lieutenant Dewey was ordered to the steam sloop
<i>Mississippi</i>, one of the Gulf Squadron, of which
Admiral Farragut was the commander. Though
but twenty-three years of age, the young lieutenant
won the admiration of both officers and men.</p>

<p>When the fleet passed the forts below New Orleans,
the <i>Mississippi</i> was the third in the line. All
through that terrible fight, Lieutenant Dewey stood
on the bridge, amid the storm of shot and shell.
Whenever the guns flashed out in the darkness,
the sailors could see him holding firmly to the rail,  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
giving orders as calmly as though a battle were an
everyday affair.</p>

<p>When the Confederate iron-clad, <i>Pensacola</i>, tried
to ram the <i>Mississippi</i>, Lieutenant Dewey never
lost his presence of mind. By a quick move, the
<i>Mississippi</i> avoided the <i>Pensacola</i>, and passing by,
poured such a broadside into the ram that her
crew ran her ashore in a sinking condition. Admiral
Farragut praised the young lieutenant warmly
for his brave conduct in this battle.</p>

<p>About a year later the <i>Mississippi</i>, while trying
to pass the forts at Port Hudson, ran aground.
The vessel was directly in range of the enemy's
batteries, and there was no hope of saving her.
Shot after shot came crashing through her sides.</p>

<p>The officers who had the task of saving the crew
did not return to the <i>Mississippi</i> after their trip to
a place of safety. The rest of the crew were saved
by Lieutenant Dewey. He was obliged to make
several trips to the nearest vessel before he had
placed all of the crew out of danger.</p>

<p>When no one was left on board but Captain
Smith and himself, they set fire to the <i>Mississippi</i>  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in five places, so that she should not fall into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>As Dewey and the captain were about to get into
their boat, Captain Smith said: "Are you sure she
will burn, Dewey?"</p>

<p>"I will take one look more to be sure," replied
the brave lieutenant; and, at the risk of his life,
he made his way back and saw that the fires they
had started were making good headway. He then
rejoined the captain, and they pulled away from
the burning ship.</p>

<p>After the loss of the <i>Mississippi</i>, Lieutenant
Dewey was ordered to one of Admiral Farragut's
dispatch boats. The admiral often came on board
and was very friendly to the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>In 1864, Dewey was assigned to the <i>Colorado</i> as
first lieutenant. This vessel was part of the fleet
besieging Fort Fisher.</p>

<p>During the second attack on the fort, the <i>Colorado</i>
was ordered to go up close to a certain battery
and silence it. Some of the officers objected,
as the <i>Colorado</i> was a wooden vessel and had
already been badly damaged. Lieutenant Dewey  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
said, "We shall be safer in there, and the battery
can be taken in fifteen minutes." The attack was
a success and proved that Dewey was wise as well
as brave.</p>

<p>After the battle, Admiral Porter came to thank
the commander of the <i>Colorado</i> for the work that his
vessel had done. The commodore replied, "You
must thank Lieutenant Dewey. It was his move."</p>

<p>Three months later he was promoted to the rank
of lieutenant commander on account of the courage
and ability he had shown.</p>

<p>After the close of the war, Dewey's father went
to see Farragut in New York. The famous admiral
shook Dr. Dewey's hand warmly and said, "Sir!
Your son George is a worthy and brave officer and
some day will make his mark."</p>

<p>In 1884 he was made captain. He did not
receive the rank of commodore until 1896.</p>

<p>During all these years, he worked hard and did
his duty faithfully. When not on the sea, he was
at work on shore, teaching in the Naval Academy,
making marine maps, or looking after supplies for
the vessels.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Admiral Dewey's sailors are very fond of him,
for although he is strict he is always just. The
two things which he especially dislikes are disobedience
and untruth.</p>

<p>On one occasion, when captain of the <i>Dolphin</i>,
his lieutenant reported that one of the men had
refused to perform some task on the plea that it
was not his work. Captain Dewey came on deck,
and, looking sternly at the man, said:</p>

<p>"What! you refuse to do as you are told!
Don't you know that this is mutiny?" Calling for
the guard, he ordered them to load their guns.
"Now, my man," he said, "you have just five
minutes in which to obey that order." The captain
began counting the minutes, and by the time
he had reached four, the order was obeyed.</p>

<p>At another time, while at Gibraltar, one of his
sailors who had been ashore, came aboard late at
night, very drunk. Next morning, he tried to
excuse himself to the captain by saying that he
had only had two glasses of grog, but had afterwards
been sun-struck.</p>

<p>"You are lying, my man," said Dewey. "You  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
were very drunk. I expect my men to tell me the
truth. Had you told me that you were drunk, I
would have made the punishment as light as possible.
Now you get ten days in irons for lying."</p>

<p>In January, 1898, Commodore Dewey was
ordered to take command of the Asiatic Squadron
at Hong Kong, China.</p>


<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The American Navy in Cuban Waters.</span></h3>

<p>While Admiral Dewey had been winning fame
at Manila, the Navy Department had organized
two other fleets which were to be used nearer
home.</p>

<p>One of these was called the Flying Squadron
because it was composed of fast cruisers. It was
stationed at Hampton Roads. From this point,
it could move quickly either north or south to protect
the cities on the Atlantic coast in case they
should be attacked by a Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>The commander of the Flying Squadron was
Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, later a rear  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
admiral. He was an experienced officer. He
had graduated from Annapolis in time to serve
all through the Civil War.</p>

<p>In 1884, he commanded the relief expedition
which rescued Lieutenant Greely and his exploring
party at Cape Sabine.
To do this, he had to
sail through fourteen hundred
miles of ice-covered
ocean.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/218schley.png" width="225" height="269" alt="ADMIRAL SCHLEY." title="" />
<span class="caption">ADMIRAL SCHLEY.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1891, he commanded
the <i>Baltimore</i>, stationed at
Valparaiso. One day, a
party of his sailors who
had gone on shore for pleasure,
were attacked by a mob. Two of them were
killed and the rest were made prisoners.</p>

<p>Captain Schley boldly went on shore and
demanded the release of his men, and a sum of
money for those who had been killed. As he
intimated that a refusal would be followed by a
bombardment from the guns of his vessel, the
demand was granted.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the man that the government had
selected to command the Flying Squadron.</p>

<p>The other fleet was much larger, and was called
the North Atlantic Squadron. It was composed
of great battleships, monitors, cruisers, and torpedo-boats.
This squadron
was to blockade the ports
of Cuba in order to prevent
any foreign vessel from
bringing aid to the Spanish
soldiers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/219sampson.png" width="225" height="289" alt="ADMIRAL SAMPSON." title="" />
<span class="caption">ADMIRAL SAMPSON.</span>
</div>

<p>This fleet was under the
command of Captain William
T. Sampson, who was
also made a rear admiral a
little later in the war. The government could well
trust this important duty to Admiral Sampson.
Graduating from Annapolis in 1861, he had
served through the Civil War, and afterward,
step by step, had won promotion.</p>

<p>During these years he had seen service in both
the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and had occupied
many responsible positions in the Navy Department  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
on shore. He had also been one of the
committee that had investigated the loss of the
battleship <i>Maine</i>.</p>

<p>All this had prepared him for the great task of
commanding the North Atlantic Squadron. The
prudence and judgment with which he performed
this duty proved that the government had made
a wise selection.</p>

<p>The people of America were still rejoicing over
the victory at Manila, when the news came that
the Spanish admiral, Cervera, with four of the
finest cruisers in the world, and three of the latest
kind of torpedo boat destroyers, had sailed from
the Canary Islands for the United States. This
caused some alarm, and wild reports were spread
as to what these vessels might do. Admiral
Sampson, with his fleet, was guarding the West
Indian waters, and Commodore Schley, with his
Flying Squadron, was waiting at Hampton
Roads in case Admiral Cervera should sail
north. If the Spanish admiral could evade these
fleets, he might bombard the cities on the Atlantic
coast.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Cruise of the Oregon.</span></h3>

<p>In the meanwhile, the greatest anxiety was felt
for the United States battleship <i>Oregon</i>. When
the <i>Maine</i> was destroyed, this vessel was at the
Mare Island Navy Yard near San Francisco.
Before war was declared she had been ordered to
join the squadron of Admiral Sampson as soon as
possible.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/221oregon.png" width="400" height="164" alt="THE OREGON." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE OREGON.</span>
</div>

<p>To do this she must travel through fourteen
thousand miles of stormy sea, through the dangerous
passage around Cape Horn and then up the
eastern shore of South America.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, commanded by Captain
Clark, she sailed from San Francisco, entering
the straits of Magellan on the 17th of April. On  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the same day that Admiral Dewey reached the
Philippines, the <i>Oregon</i> arrived at Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil.</p>

<p>Every American was full of anxiety for the
great battleship. Surely Admiral Cervera would
arrive in the West Indian waters before the
<i>Oregon</i> could pass through them. But swiftly
and steadily the great ship came on.</p>

<p>Finally, on the 24th of May, the <i>Oregon</i> sighted
the harbor lights of Key West, and soon reached
a safe port. The very next day, Captain Clark
reported her ready for duty. She had steamed
the length of two oceans and not a valve was
broken nor a repair needed.</p>

<p>Much praise is due to Captain Clark for bringing
his vessel such a distance in desperate haste
in order to help fight the nation's battles. But
we must not forget that it was the chief engineer,
Robert W. Milligen, and his seventy men, who
made this possible. In spite of the terrible heat
in the engine rooms, these brave fellows worked
untiringly to keep the great ship moving steadily
day and night around the continent.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/223map.png" width="400" height="520" alt="MAP OF HARBOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA." title="" />
<span class="caption">MAP OF HARBOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA.</span>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 11th of May, an unfortunate
affair had occurred in the harbor of Cardenas, on
the northern coast of Cuba. Three of the American
vessels blockading this harbor had been
ordered to explore
the bay.
Suddenly the
Spanish batteries
on the
shore opened
fire. The torpedo
boat
<i>Winslow</i>, being
nearest
the shore, received
most
of the enemy's
shells. Although
bravely
returning
the fire, the little boat was soon disabled. Five
men were wounded, and Ensign Worth Bagley
and four other men were killed. These were  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the first Americans to lose their lives in this
war.</p>

<p>On the following day, the Americans heard that
the Spanish fleet had arrived at Martinique, a
small French Island near the coast of Venezuela.
This being known, Commodore Schley
sailed from Hampton Roads for the West Indies.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May, Admiral Cervera sailed
into the harbor of Santiago de Cuba, on the southern
coast of Cuba, and was there several days
before the Americans found it out. Commodore
Schley hastened at once to the mouth of the harbor
so as to cut off all hope of escape for the
Spanish admiral. Admiral Sampson soon arrived
with the main squadron, and the entire fleet kept
watch, frequently bombarding the forts at the
harbor's mouth.</p>

<p>The Americans did not attempt to pass into
the harbor, as the entrance was strongly protected
by torpedoes; so they waited for a land
force to arrive, and attack the enemy from the
rear.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lieutenant Hobson and the Merrimac.</span></h3>

<p>Soon after Admiral Sampson arrived off Santiago,
there came to him a young lieutenant,
Richmond Pearson Hobson. He had a plan which
he wished to propose. He said:</p>

<p>"There is the collier
<i>Merrimac</i>. Let a volunteer
crew just large enough
to navigate her be selected.
Then, after stripping the
old ship of everything valuable,
let this crew run
her, after dark, into the
narrowest part of the channel
leading to the harbor;
and there let them sink her
by exploding torpedoes under her. In this way
we can block the harbor so that Admiral Cervera
cannot in any way bring out his fleet."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/225hobson.png" width="225" height="320" alt="LIEUTENANT HOBSON." title="" />
<span class="caption">LIEUTENANT HOBSON.</span>
</div>

<p>He explained that the crew of the <i>Merrimac</i>
would jump overboard as she sank, and, if possible,
be picked up by a torpedo-boat or a steam
launch, which should be stationed near-by for that  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
purpose. Lieutenant Hobson himself, bravely
offered to lead this expedition.</p>

<p>Admiral Sampson determined to carry out this
plan, and called for a single volunteer from each
ship. In spite of the danger of the undertaking,
almost the entire crew of each vessel, not only
offered to go, but begged to be accepted. Finally,
eight men were chosen, with Lieutenant
Hobson as their leader. At half-past two o'clock
in the morning of June 3d, the <i>Merrimac</i> was
headed straight for the channel. Lieutenant
Hobson stood on the bridge dressed in full
uniform. The other men were at their posts
dressed in tights, ready to swim a long distance,
if necessary.</p>

<p>The crew of the steam launch, which was following
closely behind, saw the <i>Merrimac</i> swing
across the channel and then heard the explosions.
At the same time, the air was filled with the
flash and roar of the guns of the Spanish forts and
ships.</p>

<p>In the face of all this fire, and without even a
cry of distress to guide them, the crew of the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
launch began their search for the heroes of the
<i>Merrimac</i>, never giving it up until daylight.
Then, seeing nothing but the tops of the masts of
the collier, they returned to the admiral's flagship.</p>

<p>Of what had happened to his men in the meantime,
Lieutenant Hobson himself told afterward:</p>

<p>"When the boat began to sink, and the Spanish
shot to fall about us, I told the men to lie flat on
the deck. It was due to their splendid discipline,
that we were not killed. The minutes seemed
hours, but I said that we must lie there until daylight.
Now and then one of the men would say,
'Hadn't we better drop off now, sir?' But I said,
'Wait until daylight.' I hoped that by that time
we might be recognized and saved.</p>

<p>"The old <i>Merrimac</i> kept sinking. It was splendid
the way the men behaved. The fire from the
batteries and ships was dreadful. As the water
came up on the decks, we caught hold of the edges
of the raft which was tied to the boom, and hung
on, our heads only being above water.</p>

<p>"A Spanish launch then came toward the <i>Merrimac</i>.
As she drew near, the men saw us, and a  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
half-dozen marines pointed their rifles at our heads.
'Is there any officer in that boat to receive a surrender
of prisoners of war?' I shouted. An old
man leaned out of the launch and waved his
hand. It was Admiral Cervera. The marines
lowered their rifles and we were helped into the
launch."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/228morrocastle.png" width="450" height="229" alt="THE MORRO CASTLE, COMMANDING THE ENTRANCE OF THE HARBOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE MORRO CASTLE, COMMANDING THE ENTRANCE OF THE HARBOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA.</span>
</div>

<p>A few hours later, a boat bearing a flag of truce
came out to the American fleet. It was from Admiral
Cervera, and brought the message that
Lieutenant Hobson and his men were held as  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
prisoners, and that they were well, only two of
them being slightly wounded.</p>

<p>Much honor is due to Lieutenant Hobson for
this brave deed. But we must not forget that the
lives of the crew were saved through the kindness
and nobility of Admiral Cervera. Not every commander
would so honor his brave prisoners, and
his action has been much appreciated in America.</p>

<p>The sinking of the <i>Merrimac</i> did not obstruct the
channel completely. The steering gear was broken
by some of the Spanish shot, and Lieutenant Hobson
was not able to place the vessel exactly where
he had intended. However, it would be a dangerous
undertaking for the Spanish admiral to pass
out of the harbor at night.</p>

<p>Admiral Sampson sent word to the War Department,
that, if an army were sent to assist him on
land, they could take the city of Santiago, together
with the fleet of Admiral Cervera in the harbor.
Accordingly General Shafter, with a large army,
landed near Santiago and began to drive the
Spaniards back into the city.</p>

<p>Desperate battles were fought at Siboney, El  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Caney, and San Juan, but the Americans steadily
drove the enemy inside the fortifications of Santiago.
During these attacks, the fleets helped the
army by throwing shells into the city.</p>


<h3>VIII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Destruction of Cervera's Fleet.</span></h3>

<p>On Sunday morning, July 3d, the American ships
were lying quietly outside the harbor of Santiago.
They were stretched in a
line from Commodore
Schley's flagship, the
<i>Brooklyn</i>, seven miles eastward,
where Admiral Sampson
had gone with his flagship
<i>New York</i>, in order to
confer with General Shafter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/230cervera.png" width="225" height="271" alt="ADMIRAL CERVERA." title="" />
<span class="caption">ADMIRAL CERVERA.</span>
</div>

<p>From the forts on the
shore, the great ships
looked like mere specks upon the horizon; and it
was hard to realize that they were grim sentinels
watching every movement of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The "bright work" had all been cleaned and  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the men were at Sunday services, when suddenly a
thin film of smoke was observed to rise behind the
hills. The scene on the battleships was changed
at once into one of greatest activity.</p>

<p>"The enemy is coming out!" was signaled in
red, white, and blue from vessel to vessel, and on
each deck rang out the command, "All hands clear
ship for action!"</p>

<p>There was no confusion or noise, and every man
was at his post. Powder magazines were opened,
and shot and shell were being hoisted to the decks.
The engineers stood waiting for the first command
with every rod and wheel of the great machinery
ready to move.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the film of smoke had become a thick
cloud, and the Americans knew that soon the Spanish
vessels would appear. Suddenly the flagship
of the Spanish admiral was seen speeding out of
the narrow channel. She passed the wreck of the
<i>Merrimac</i>, and with the spray dashing high over
her bows, started westward along the coast.</p>

<p>Close behind her came another vessel, and then
another, until the six Spanish ships were all rushing  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
wildly for the open sea. At full speed, the
<i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>Texas</i>, <i>Iowa</i>, and <i>Oregon</i> bore down upon
the Spanish ships. The <i>Oregon</i> gained headway
so rapidly that she passed the <i>Texas</i> and the <i>Iowa</i>,
and came in behind the <i>Brooklyn</i>.</p>

<p>Away to the right between the battleships and
the shore, sped the little yacht <i>Gloucester</i>. Her
captain, Lieutenant Richard Wainwright, had been
an officer on the <i>Maine</i> when that vessel was blown
up in Havana harbor, and so was, perhaps, most
anxious of all for a chance at the Spanish.</p>

<p>He sent the <i>Gloucester</i> straight towards the Spanish
torpedo boats, <i>Pluton</i> and <i>Furor</i>. He did not
seem to mind the fact that his little yacht was no
match for them, and that his decks were covered
with Spanish shell. Although aided to some extent
by the large vessels, the destruction of the two
torpedo boats was due to Lieutenant Wainwright.
He never paused in his deadly fire until both of
them had surrendered. It was not long, however,
until the Spanish shots began to fall about the other
American ships, throwing up great columns of
water.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Brooklyn</i> was the first to reach the Spanish
ships and open fire. The <i>Oregon</i> hastened to
assist Commodore Schley. When the Americans
saw that not only the <i>Oregon</i>, but the <i>Texas</i> and
<i>Iowa</i> were gaining on the Spanish, they were wild
with excitement. The stokers in the engine rooms
poured in the coal, and the steam rose higher and
higher.</p>

<p>At half-past ten the battle was at its height.
Great clouds of smoke settled over the water, and
the roar of the guns echoed back from the Santiago
hills. Now and then anxious inquiry passed from
one American crew to another; but the answer,
"All right!" always came back through the din of
battle.</p>

<p>One by one the Spanish guns became silent,
and by eleven o'clock all save one of the enemy's
ships had been driven ashore, and destroyed.
The <i>Cristobal Colon</i> made a desperate dash for
freedom, and was not overtaken until she had gone
fifty miles west of Santiago. Then she surrendered,
having been forced ashore.</p>

<p>After the battle was over the Americans bravely  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
went to the rescue of the Spanish sailors. They
climbed the ladders and went into the burning
ships, where magazines were likely to explode at
any moment. They lifted the wounded men from
the hot decks and took them out of the stifling
smoke to their own vessels. Their boats picked
up the Spaniards who were struggling in the water
or trying to climb up on the shore.</p>

<p>The Spanish loss on that Sunday was about
three hundred killed and one hundred and fifty
wounded, while nearly a thousand men were taken
prisoners by the Americans. The Spanish vessels
were all complete wrecks. There was but one
American killed and one wounded.</p>

<p>Admiral Cervera was a brave man. He took his
fleet out of the Santiago harbor against his own
judgment, because he had been ordered to do so
by the Spanish government at Madrid.</p>

<p>Everything was against him. Many of his
officers had been given their commissions because
their families were rich and powerful in Spain.
The sailors had not entered the navy from choice,
but had been forced to do so by the government.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Many of them had been kidnapped from their
homes, or from the wharves of seaport towns, and
forced on board. They were ill treated and poorly
paid. On the morning of the battle at Santiago
they were threatened with pistols before they would
go out to meet the Americans.</p>

<p>On the other hand, every man in the American
fleet had been thoroughly trained for the work that
he had to do, and was fighting for a country which
he loved better than life itself. He felt that it was
an honor to serve in the navy, and knew that
many of his countrymen would be glad to be in his
place.</p>

<p>Now let us see what has become of Lieutenant
Hobson and his men. During all this time they
had been held as prisoners in Santiago. Three
days after the destruction of the Spanish fleet,
arrangements were made to exchange them for
some Spanish prisoners. This exchange was
made between the Spanish and American lines
near Santiago.</p>

<p>When the formalities were over and Hobson
and his men approached the first American line, all  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the men cheered wildly and crowded one upon
another for a chance to shake hands with the
heroes. Lieutenant Hobson was the hero of the
hour. He alone was calm, and he modestly said
that any other man would have done the same
thing in his place.</p>


<h3>IX.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The End of the War.</span></h3>

<p>After the loss of Admiral Cervera's fleet, every
one knew that it would be only a question of time
until the city of Santiago must surrender. The
American army under General Miles and General
Shafter surrounded the city on the land, while the
navy guarded the harbor. The Spaniards could
not escape, nor could any help reach them.</p>

<p>The next two weeks were spent in trying to fix
upon terms of surrender that would be acceptable
to both sides. The only fighting was a short bombardment
of the city by the warships on the 10th
of July.</p>

<p>At last on July 17th the city surrendered. The
Spaniards agreed to give up not only Santiago but  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
also all the cities and forts east of that place, with
all the soldiers and military supplies. The Americans
agreed to send all these soldiers, numbering
about 22,000 men, back to Spain, and pay for their
transportation.</p>

<p>After this surrender, General Miles with an army
on transport ships sailed for the island of Porto
Rico, which is about four hundred miles from Cuba.
As usual, the navy went along to protect the unarmed
vessels and to help the army make a
landing.</p>

<p>The first fighting was on the southern coast, near
the city of Ponce, in the harbor of Guanica.
Lieutenant Wainwright, with his little ship the
<i>Gloucester</i>, sailed boldly into the harbor and drove
the Spaniards from the shore. The Americans
were then landed without the loss of a single
man.</p>

<p>The army was divided into three divisions, and
all set out for the city of San Juan upon the
northern coast. They drove the Spaniards before
them, taking possession of the towns and cities as
they advanced.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>General Miles and his soldiers were everywhere
welcomed gladly, for the people of this island did
not like the Spanish soldiers any better than did
the Cubans.</p>

<p>By the 26th of July, the people of Spain had
begun to realize that it was useless to carry on the
war any longer. Accordingly, word was sent to
President McKinley, by the French ambassador
at Washington, M. Jules Cambon, that the Spanish
government was ready to consider terms of peace.</p>

<p>President McKinley and his cabinet at once
drew up a paper called a protocol, which stated
what the Spanish must do before the war could
be ended.</p>

<p>Spain was to give up all claim to Cuba, recall
her officials and soldiers, and permit the people
of the island to choose their own government.
Porto Rico and all the Spanish islands in the
West Indies were to be given to the United
States. Spain was also to allow the Americans
to hold the city of Manila until it should be
decided, by a regular treaty, what should be done
with the Philippine Islands. Five men from each  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
country should be appointed to draw up the
treaty, and in the meantime, as soon as Spain
and the United States should sign the protocol,
all fighting should cease.</p>

<p>Spain was glad to get peace, even on these
terms, and the protocol was duly signed by both
governments on the 12th of August. Word was
at once sent to the armies and navies to cease
fighting.</p>

<p>It was very easy to reach the American forces
in Cuba and Porto Rico, but before the message
could reach Admiral Dewey at Manila, it must be
telegraphed to Hong Kong, China, and then sent
by a dispatch boat to Manila. During the summer
vessel after vessel had sailed from San Francisco,
carrying the army of General Merritt to
assist Admiral Dewey. War vessels and ammunition
had also been sent.</p>

<p>On the 13th of August, not having heard that
peace had been declared, General Merritt ordered
a combined attack of the army and navy to be
made upon Manila. The vessels opened fire upon
the Spanish fortifications which protected the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
town, while the troops of General Merritt drove
the Spaniards back into the city. After two hours
of sharp fighting the city surrendered.</p>

<p>The Americans did not lose a single sailor, and
only twelve soldiers were killed and forty wounded.
The Spanish loss was much greater. In the afternoon
the stars and stripes were hoisted over the
government building and the Spanish soldiers
marched out of the city and laid down their arms.</p>

<p>Thus with a brilliant victory, Admiral Dewey
closed the war as he had opened it.</p>

<p>After the signing of the protocol Admiral Sampson
and Commodore Schley sailed to New York
with most of their squadrons to repair what little
damage had been done. When they arrived on
the 20th of August the city gave them a royal
welcome. It was arranged that the warships
should steam through the harbor and up the Hudson
River as far as General Grant's tomb. Thus
every one could see and greet the naval heroes.
The people turned out by the tens of thousands
and lined the shores cheering and waving flags.
The harbor and river were filled with pleasure  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
boats adorned with flags and streamers, while
cannon on the shore thundered salutes.</p>

<p>In all history there is not an instance of such
great victories with so small a loss of men and
ships as in this war with Spain. In less than three
months the United States had driven the Spanish
power from the western hemisphere. It had
added new possessions in both hemispheres and
had shown that it was entitled to rank with the
most powerful nations of the earth.</p>

<p>As soon as the people of the United States felt
that peace was assured they held great jubilees in
Chicago and Philadelphia. Triumphal arches
were erected under which marched the heroes of
the war, cheered to the echo by their fellow
citizens.</p>

<p>Several new battleships more powerful than
any that had taken part in the recent splendid
victories were launched, with imposing ceremonies,
at Newport News, Virginia.</p>

<p>From all this it would seem that the people of
the United States at last realized that at all times,
whether in peace or war, the country should have  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a powerful navy. This navy should be in keeping
with the position that the United States has won
among the nations of the world, and worthy of
the brave officers and sailors who spend their lives
in its service.</p>


<h3>X.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Life on an American Man-of-War.</span></h3>

<p>When a battleship is hurling shot and shell at
an enemy, the brave deeds of the officers and
men on board are told from one end of the land
to the other; but how many people know how these
men live from day to day, when the great ship is
lying in the harbor, or cruising peacefully about
the seas?</p>

<p>Who makes the lieutenant's bed and buys his
food? Most people think that the government
provides all that he needs; but this is not so. He
must carry his own bed linen to sea with him and
arrange for his own food.</p>

<p>The officers choose one of their number to buy
the provisions, and he must give good meals at
one dollar a day for each man. At the end of  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the month, every officer pays this amount out of
his salary.</p>

<p>The first meal of the day is always eggs, and is
served at any time from 7:30 until 8:30 in the
morning. If ever a naval officer invites you to
breakfast, he does not expect you to come to this
meal. He calls a twelve o'clock luncheon breakfast,
and will give you a substantial meal at that
time. Dinner is served at 6 or 6:30, and, on the
flagship, is accompanied by the band.</p>

<p>The ward-room boys who wait upon the officers
are almost all Japanese. Because their names are
so hard to pronounce, every one is called "William."
When the big ship is hurling shot and shell
in time of battle, where is William? In the pantry
washing dishes? No, indeed.</p>

<p>Somebody must be down in the magazine putting
the powder on the hoists which carry it up to
the guns. This is William's work. In time of
fire, it is he who holds the nozzle of the hose, or
who brings hammocks to smother the flames.</p>

<p>Now "Jacky," as the sailor man is called, does
not provide his food or his bed-linen. His bed is  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a hammock, and it is a very different one from
those we swing on our porches in summer. It is
made of canvas, with ropes in the ends. He has
a mattress and a blanket in his bed, and he always
keeps them there.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the morning the bugle calls, and
Jacky has six minutes in which to scramble out of
his bed and get into his clothes. Then he must
roll up his hammock and stow it away. Jacky
then has some hard tack and coffee before he goes
to work.</p>

<p>From half-past five until six he does his laundry
work. He wears white suits and must wash them
himself; untidiness is never excused. The clothes
are then hung so as to be dry for the inspection
drill which will come at half-past nine.</p>

<p>Then for one hour, the ship is scrubbed. Water
pours over the decks in streams. Every nook and
cranny is numbered, and each man has his own
number to keep clean.</p>

<p>By half-past seven there is nothing cleaner on
land or sea. The ship shines from prow to stern,
and the decks are clean enough to eat from.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Every piece of metal is polished until it glitters
in the sunlight.</p>

<p>When this is finished, Jacky has his breakfast.
The government allows thirty cents a day for the
rations of each sailor. The paymaster serves out
food enough to last several days or sometimes a
week, and if the cook does not make this last the
crew must go hungry.</p>

<p>The sailors are divided into "messes," each
mess having its own cook who is under the direction
of the general ship's cook. Jacky has no
table-cloth or napkins. He washes his own tin
plate, cup, knife, fork, and spoon, when he has
finished his hasty meal.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, he is dressed for the day, and
the colors go up. From then until six o'clock in
the evening he is busy with different drills and
duties about the ship. In the evening, from six
until eight o'clock, Jacky has an easy time. It is
then that he takes his ease, smoking his pipe and
singing his songs.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock "taps" are sounded, and once
more he rolls up in his hammock for the night.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturday is mending day, and every man must
do his own work. Some of the men make their
own clothes, although there is a tailor on board.
In the ship's crew there are also barbers, shoemakers,
and printers.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the captain goes about the
ship and gravely inspects the men, and it is then
that each one tries to look his best. Then they
must all attend religious services, after which they
rest most of the day.</p>

<p>The marines on a ship-of-war are men about
whom most people know nothing. A marine is
not a sailor. He is a soldier who does duty on a
warship. He is a kind of policeman, and sees
that Jacky behaves himself. He wears a soldier's
uniform and has soldier's drills.</p>

<p>The marines have their own mess and their
own sleeping space, forming a community of their
own.</p>

<p>Perhaps some boys and girls may think that the
captain and his officers have a much easier time
than Jacky or the marines. This is not so.
In the first place, they had many studies to  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
master before they could be officers. They had
to earn a great deal about mathematics, mechanical
and electrical engineering, navigation, gunnery,
and international law. And then these
studies are never ended; the progress that is made
in them, each year all over the world, must be
known by each officer.</p>

<p>The officers are responsible for the lives of the
crew and the safety of the ship. They must be
ready to think and act quickly in emergencies.
In hours of peril they never leave their
posts.</p>


<h3>XI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Some Facts about the Navy of 1898.</span></h3>

<p>The Constitution of the United States provides
that the President shall be commander-in-chief
not only of the army but also of the navy. His
chief assistant in the management of naval affairs
is the Secretary of the Navy, who is also a member
of his cabinet.</p>

<p>In 1898 the Navy Department of the United  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
States was just one hundred years old, having
been organized in 1798 with Benjamin Stoddert as
Secretary.</p>

<p>The work of the department is divided among
eight bureaus, as follows:</p>

<p>1. The Bureau of Yards and Docks, which is intrusted
with the construction and maintenance of
docks and wharves, and with all civil engineering
work in the navy yards.</p>

<p>2. The Bureau of Navigation, which superintends
the education of officers and men, controls
the enlistment of men and apprentices, and directs
the movements of ships and fleets.</p>

<p>3. The Bureau of Equipment, which attends to
the manufacture of ropes, anchors, cables, and
other articles required for the equipment of naval
vessels, purchases coal for their use, and controls
the Naval Observatory.</p>

<p>4. The Bureau of Ordnance, which has charge
of the manufacture of guns and ammunition, also
of torpedo stations and magazines.</p>

<p>5. The Bureau of Construction and Repair,
which is charged with the building and repair of  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
small boats and of the hulls of ships, and attends
to the purchase of turrets and armor.</p>

<p>6. The Bureau of Steam Engineering, which
directs the building and repairing of machinery in
any way connected with the ships.</p>

<p>7. The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, which
designs, erects, and maintains naval hospitals
and superintends their management.</p>

<p>8. The Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, which
is responsible for the purchase and supply of all
provisions and stores, and of the accounts relating
to the same.</p>

<p>Each of these bureaus is presided over by an
officer of skill and experience, who, while he holds
the office, has the rank of commodore.</p>

<p>The United States has navy yards at Portsmouth,
New Hampshire; Boston, Massachusetts;
Brooklyn, New York; League Island, Pennsylvania;
Norfolk, Virginia; Washington, District of
Columbia; and Mare Island, California. At these
navy yards ships are overhauled and repaired,
machinery is adjusted and renewed, and stores
of all kinds are provided. Here, too, on the  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
receiving ships, the recruits are received and instructed.</p>

<p>There are naval stations at Newport, Rhode
Island; New London, Connecticut; Port Royal,
South Carolina; Key West and Pensacola, Florida;
and Puget Sound, Washington.</p>

<p>At Indian Head, Maryland, is the naval proving-ground
for the test of armor and guns.</p>

<p>The Naval Observatory is at Washington, and
was at first merely a depot for naval charts and
instruments.</p>

<p>In 1898, the highest officer in the American
navy was the rear admiral. The other officers in
their order, ranking downward, were commodores,
captains, commanders, lieutenant commanders,
lieutenants, lieutenants junior grade, and ensigns.
All these are known as officers of the line.</p>

<p>At the close of the year there were seven rear
admirals, ten commodores, forty-one captains, and
eighty-five commanders.</p>

<p>The rank of rear admiral is equal to that of
major general in the army. A commodore is equal
to a brigadier general; a captain in the navy ranks  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
with a colonel in the army; a commander ranks
with a lieutenant colonel; and a lieutenant in the
navy is equal to a captain in the army.</p>

<p>The law provides that when an officer reaches
the age of sixty-two years he must be retired from
active service. One who has been disabled in the
service, or who has served honorably for forty
years and requests release, may also be retired.
Officers on the retired list receive three-fourths as
much pay as when on active duty at sea.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Dewey will be retired on the 26th
of December, 1899. In 1898 there were thirty-three
rear admirals on the retired lists.</p>

<p>The officers while at sea receive more pay than
when on shore duty. The salary of an ensign at
sea is $1200 a year; that of a rear admiral is
$6,000. The salaries of the other officers range
between these two extremes.</p>

<p>Previous to 1898 the number of enlisted men in
the navy was limited to ten thousand. These men
are received for a period of three years; and any
one after serving continuously for twenty years may
be assigned to duty in the navy yards, or on board  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
receiving ships, or to other duties not requiring
them to go far from home. All who have served
thirty years are entitled to admittance in the Naval
Home. The wages of enlisted men vary from $16
to $70 a month, according to the kind of work they
perform.</p>

<p>The law provides that seven hundred and fifty
boys may be enlisted as apprentices in the navy.
These are received only with the consent of their
parents or guardians, and are required to serve
until they are twenty-one years old.</p>

<p>Besides the regular navy of the United States
there is a naval militia organized in eighteen states.
This militia is under the general direction of the
Assistant Secretary of the Navy; and its duty in
time of war is to man the vessels designed for coast
and harbor defense.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1898 there were
more than four thousand men and officers in the
naval militia. During the war with Spain, most of
these were mustered into the naval service and did
duty on the war vessels or in the signal service
along the coast.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the year there were belonging to
our government nine battleships, all of which had
been built since 1890. Four others were in process
of construction. The average cost of vessels of
this class is about $3,500,000.</p>

<p>Of other vessels in the navy of 1898, there were
two armored cruisers which cost $2,986,000 each;
one ram, the <i>Katahdin</i>; six double turreted monitors;
thirteen single turreted monitors; seventeen
protected cruisers; four unarmored cruisers; fifteen
gunboats; and ten torpedo boats. Many other
vessels of different classes were being built.</p>

<p>All these were in active service, or soon to be so.
But there were also several other vessels of the
old-fashioned style which, although of little use in
battle, were valuable in the various peaceful enterprises
in which the navy is always engaged. Of
such there were six old iron vessels and ten wooden
frigates, all propelled by steam, and seventeen old
wooden sailing vessels, some of which were used as
receiving ships.</p>

<p>During the war with Spain, many temporary
additions were made to the navy. Eleven merchant  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
vessels were bought or leased and converted
into auxiliary cruisers. Among these were the
four fast steamers of the American line, the <i>St.
Louis</i>, the <i>St. Paul</i>, the <i>Yale</i>, and the <i>Harvard</i>.</p>

<p>Twenty-eight yachts also were purchased and
turned into auxiliary gunboats or torpedo boats.
Among these was the <i>Gloucester</i>, which did such
fine work during the destruction of Cervera's fleet.
It had formerly been a pleasure yacht belonging to
Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan of New York.</p>

<p>In addition to the vessels just named, the government
also bought twenty-seven tugs to be
changed into gunboats or cruisers; and it obtained
seventeen steam vessels of various sizes to be used
as transports and for many other purposes.</p>

<p>Altogether the navy of 1898 comprised an imposing
collection of vessels of many kinds and of
various degrees of efficiency. Of the work which
it accomplished we have already learned.  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

book was produced from scanned images of public domain
material from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
